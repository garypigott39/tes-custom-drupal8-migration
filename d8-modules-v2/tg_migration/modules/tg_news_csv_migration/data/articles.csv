"341069","Beeping fire alarm ruined my beeping night’s sleep","/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/beeping-fire-alarm-ruined-my-beeping-nights-sleep","This teacher finds one child’s hyperactivity difficult to cope with after a disagreement with a smoke alarm robbed him of precious sleep the night before","<p>McCartney’s hyperactivity isn’t why I’m exhausted; it’s because the smoke alarm at the bottom of our stairs chose to wake me up in the dead of night. If it had been to tell me that the house was on fire, I wouldn’t have minded, but it was only to let me know that it had a low battery.</p>

<p>There I was in the middle of a deeply satisfying sleep when an annoying little beep crept into the bedroom and prodded me awake.</p>

<p>I’m not using “beep” in place of an obscenity, although obscenities were in my thoughts. They were eventually joined by some other words and, in the fullness of time, formed a plan. It involved me creeping round to the other side of the room in the dark and shutting the bedroom door. Despite the obvious fire risk, Mrs Eddison insists on sleeping with it open. For reasons that are mainly menopausal, she also enjoys kicking the duvet off and throwing the windows open. On the way back to bed, I replaced the former and closed the latter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It reminded me of the time I tried ignoring Jordan when he was hitting himself on the head with a ruler</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My hope was that, with the bedroom door shut, a small beep would go unheard. But trying not to hear a beep involves actively listening for one. Consequently, it remained irritatingly audible and even more difficult to disregard. It reminded me of the time I tried tactically ignoring Jordan when he was repeatedly hitting himself on the head with a ruler. He wouldn’t stop, and neither would this. Eventually, I went to t’ foot of our stairs (as we say in Yorkshire) to resolve the bleeping situation once and for all.</p>

<p>But this turned out to be more difficult than I imagined when my short stature conspired with a low dining chair and a high ceiling to keep the alarm out of reach. Anyone who says size doesn’t matter hasn’t had a beeping smoke alarm two inches from their grasp. I had no choice but to cold-foot it out to the garage to get the steps.</p>

<h2><font color=""0083BD"">Fuming over a smoke alarm</font></h2>

<p>“This’ll shut you up,” I hissed as I fiddled with the alarm’s inner workings. My triumph was short-lived. In an attempt to convince Mrs Eddison that I’d been making illicit toast, it defied its low-battery status and broke into a frenzy of shrieking.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My wife wanted to know why I’d put our lives at risk by leaving it without a battery</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even after I explained, my wife remained unimpressed. She wanted to know why I couldn’t have waited until morning; why I’d now put our lives at risk by leaving it without a battery; and why I couldn’t keep my cold feet to myself. Ten minutes later she sat up and asked the trickiest question of all: “Did you remember to lock the door after you came in from the garage?”</p>

<p>By mid-morning, my energy levels are running seriously low. The situation is not helped by McCartney, who is metaphorically (and sometimes literally) bouncing off the walls. “They’re trying him on some new medication,” says Miss Fatalism. “They reckon it could take weeks to get the dosage right.”</p>

<p>“It’s not the dosage they need to get right, it’s the voltage,” I reply. “Somebody should take his batteries out.”</p>

"341741","‘We need to stop thinking of research as a magic bullet’","/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/we-need-stop-thinking-research-a-magic-bullet","Growth mindset theory has come in for criticism but its originator Carol Dweck says teachers expect too much from academics – new concepts should be seen as works in progress, rather than fix-alls","<p>Will growth mindset become a case of another educational “magic bullet” from academia that was hailed, hyped and then devalued?</p>

<p>I believe not. I believe it will be something different: a case of teachers feeding back their valuable experiences (positive and negative) and researchers responding. I believe growth mindset can be the first approach to chart a different relationship between academics and teachers.</p>

<p>I want us to create a new paradigm based on the idea that every concept and its implementation represents a work in progress, a long-term collaboration between researchers and practitioners, all aiming at the same thing: helping students. I hope that we are already proving this is possible.</p>

<p>By 2006, research was showing that children’s mindsets about their abilities could play a role in their motivation and achievement. Students who believed that intellectual abilities could be developed (a growth mindset) often showed greater motivation and better grades than those who believed that intellectual abilities were fixed (a fixed mindset), particularly when they were facing challenges in school. And, when fixed-mindset students were taught a growth mindset, through a carefully constructed programme, they too showed these benefits.</p>

<p>Today, researchers have seen these effects in dozens of studies with thousands of students. In one recent study with nearly all the 10th grade public school students in Chile (about 168,000), young people’s mindsets predicted their achievement scores at every level of family income.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Will growth mindset be hailed, hyped and then devalued? I believe not</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another recent study, led by David Yeager, involved a representative sample of 14,000 9th grade students across the US making the transition to high school. Those students who received a growth mindset programme showed a greater desire for challenging tasks than those in the control group, who received a different programme – and this was true at every level of the maths curriculum. The data on their grades will be available soon (see references box, below).</p>

<p>Of course, as the researchers behind growth mindset, we were excited about these findings and so were educators. Mindsets provided a new lens for understanding students’ motivation and achievement, and it was one of the first systematic programmes of research to provide a basis for educational practice. What’s more, we could influence mindsets through direct-to-student initiatives.</p>

<p>However, neither researchers nor teachers anticipated the difficulty of applying these concepts in the classroom. Perhaps as researchers we were naive. Perhaps we heard more about the successful applications than the unsuccessful ones. But as soon as we did realise the difficulty, we were the ones who sounded the alarm, both in <em>Tes</em> and in other publications.</p>

<p>Actually, we’ve done a lot more than sound the alarm. We’ve rolled up our sleeves and committed ourselves to finding answers. We have listened and reacted. What, specifically, are we doing?</p>

<p><strong><font color=""512984"">Transforming educators’ mindsets</font></strong></p>

<p>We realised that many educators who endorsed a growth mindset did not fully understand it. Some equated it with being open-minded or believing in effort – rather than believing that intellectual abilities can be developed. To address this, my colleague in Australia, educational analyst Susan Mackie, has been developing a growth mindset exercise for educators.</p>

<p>It begins by legitimising a fixed mindset. That is, it starts with the premise that we are all a mixture of fixed and growth mindsets, that we need to learn how to recognise our fixed-mindset triggers (challenge, struggle, criticism, failure), to recognise how we think, feel, and act when our fixed mindset is triggered and, if we desire to, find our way back to a growth mindset.</p>

<p>I have seen her working with educators and business leaders, who actually give their fixed mindset personas a name and make friends with them, inviting them to come on board with their growth mindset goals. They also talk with their colleagues about their triggers and personas. When the programme is completed, it will be tested and validated as a vehicle for mindset change in educators.</p>

<p><strong><font color=""512984"">Learning more about the adult-to-child transmission process</font></strong></p>

<p>Many educators believed that by telling students to try hard or that “You can do anything” (or by hiding differences in current abilities) they were fostering a growth mindset. This is not the case. The teacher-to-student transmission of mindsets is now a vigorous research area, and researchers are finding that when teachers focus on the learning process, the children in their classrooms develop growth mindsets.</p>

<p>What does this mean? It means, for example, that when a child is stuck, the teacher says, “Let’s sit together and figure out how you’re thinking about this, and then let’s work out some new strategies you can try.” It makes difficulty into an occasion for problem-solving together rather than discouragement. In other words, we don’t just bestow either praise or criticism; it needs to illuminate the learning process.</p>

<p><strong><font color=""512984"">Developing a growth mindset curriculum for the classroom</font></strong></p>

<p>Many educators give a lecture on growth mindset or put up posters around the room and then expect the students to embody a growth mindset. Professors Stephanie Fryberg and Mary Murphy, as well as Mackie are collaborating with educators to create an explicit, step-by-step curriculum for teachers.</p>

<p>These materials are currently being developed, evaluated, and improved, and will be available to educators in the future.</p>

<p><strong><font color=""512984"">Tools for monitoring effectiveness</font></strong></p>

<p>Dave Paunesku (creator of perts.net) is pioneering a way for teachers to monitor whether a new teaching technique is working for their students. He is creating very brief surveys that can be administered each week to students (and collated and graphed by computer) to see whether such things as students’ engagement with their classwork or their sense of academic progress has increased over time as a result of introducing the technique. If not, then teachers know that their innovation is not succeeding. This programme will be released free of charge when it has been validated.</p>

<p><strong><font color=""512984"">Online programme</font></strong></p>

<p>Finally, we will be releasing the two-session online growth mindset programme that we developed for the nationwide study in the US (the Yeager study mentioned above). Schools will soon be able to request the programme from perts.net and receive it free of charge.</p>

<p><strong><font color=""512984"">In conclusion</font></strong></p>

<p>The bottom line here is that where research and education is concerned, there are no magic bullets, only works in progress. Every practice, even a practice based on well-established research, needs to be studied and validated when it is introduced into the classroom. Then we can find out: does it work here? For whom does it not work? What can we change to make it work better?</p>

<p>We’ve demonstrated in our research that mindsets can be changed. Now we are focused on understanding what educators can do that will work for their students. Have we solved this problem? Not yet, as I am fond of saying. But we are determined to help students love challenges and thrive in the face of difficulty, so that they are ready for the jobs of the future. Our societies may depend on it. I believe that researchers and educators from all different perspectives can work together to make this happen.</p>

<p>The National Children’s Bureau is demanding resources to help track and <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/student-well-being"">support children</a> who drop out of education for months or years at a time. The charity estimates that there could be tens of thousands of such children.</p>

<p>It has called on the government to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>extend the definition of “children missing education”, so that it includes those who are still on a school roll, but are not accessing education;</li>
	<li>provide resources for schools and local authorities to identify children at risk of dropping out of school, and help them to return;</li>
	<li>collect better data at local and national level to help identify these children;</li>
	<li>share information between agencies, to ensure that children are receiving the support they need.</li>
</ul>

<p>Its new report, <strong><em><a href=""https://www.ncb.org.uk/resources-publications/resources/children-missing-education"">Missing Education</a></em></strong>, also highlights case studies of children who do not attend school or receive an education at home.</p>

<h2>Missing education</h2>

<p>Some children missed extensive periods of school, because of family circumstances or <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/scale-mental-health-issues-young-people-not-quite-a-crisis-it-will"">mental health problems</a>, or because they are being bullied at school, the report states.</p>

<p>Others were taken out of school by their families, because their parents felt that the school did not have appropriate support to deal with <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/send"">special educational needs</a> or mental health issues.</p>

<ul>
</ul>

<p>Anna Feuchtwang, chief executive of the National Children’s Bureau, said: “It’s unacceptable that tens of thousands of children in England can’t access their fundamental right to an education.</p>

<p>“These children are often very vulnerable. Away from the safety and security of school, they’re more at risk of abuse and exploitation, and are missing out on support for special educational needs and mental-health problems.”</p>

<p>Today – with just seven weeks before exams begin – education secretary Justine Greening tried to provide “clarity” around the new numerical 9-1 grades for GCSEs.</p>

<p>She announced <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/new-gcse-pass-lowered-grade-5-4-dfe-u-turn"">that grade 4 will be the “standard pass”</a> and grade 5 – originally due to be a “good pass” – will be deemed a “strong pass”.</p>

<p>Now the Department for Education has told <i>Tes</i> that from this summer schools will be judged to have met the EBacc according to percentages of pupils who achieve grade 5s in English and maths.</p>

<p>But the situation will be different for individual pupils. “In terms of achieving the EBacc, a pupil will have done so if they get a 4 in English and Maths, not a 5,” a DfE spokesperson said<i>.</i></p>

<p>The headline EBacc league table measure will be based on grade 5 but tables will also show the percentages of pupils achieving the EBacc with a grade 4 in English and maths although “this won’t be a headline measure”.</p>

<p>Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said: ""To have two different levels – one accountability measure for schools and another for pupils – is nonsense. </p>

<p>""It also doesn't clear up what a grade 4 and a grade 5 actually look like. Nobody knows.""</p>

<p>Dr Bousted added: ""These qualifications have been rushed through without any of the required sampling and testing to ensure they are going to work.</p>

<p>""As a result, you get post-haste justifications and late-in-the-day clarifications about things that should have been clear from the start.""</p>

<p>Suzanne O'Farrell, curriculum and assessment specialist at the Association of School and College Leaders, added: ""You can't have a pupil achievement in EBacc with a 4 and a school achievement in EBacc with a 5. That seems a bit confusing.""</p>

It was simple enough. Teachers would teach. Students would revise. They’d sit the tests, and then, more often than not, they would get the grades they deserved.</p>

<p>How quaint that now seems.</p>

<p>This week demonstrates the murky complexities of linking the way we judge students to the way the government judges schools.</p>

<p>First we had the <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/new-gcse-pass-lowered-grade-5-4-dfe-u-turn"">education secretary’s announcement on GCSE gradings</a>. Students gaining a new grade 4 will no longer have to face resits in English and Maths, she said. This is good news.</p>

<p>But then we learned that a grade 4 won’t be deemed sufficient when it comes to measuring schools’ success in the leagues tables.</p>

<p>Grade 4 apparently isn’t ""strong"" enough to count. So even though teachers will celebrate the achievements of students gaining grade 4, schools will be penalised if not enough students gain a 5.</p>

<p>It’s an attitude to success which is as mean-spirited as it is confusing.</p>

<h2>'Retrospective announcements' </h2>

<p>Then thousands of schools <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/schools-wont-be-judged-fast-track-ecdl-it-qualification-next-year"">received an email telling them that the European Computer Driving Licence (ECDL) qualification has been hastily pulled from next year’s performance tables</a> – even though teachers and students in classrooms across the UK are working towards the qualification.</p>

<p>Thus we see a government which uses league tables to shape the behaviour of schools (for example, incentivising English Baccalaureate subjects) and then penalises schools without warning for a qualification that isn’t in favour.</p>

<p>It simply isn’t not good enough.</p>

<p>None of it would matter so much if this wasn’t about real students and real teachers in real schools and colleges.</p>

<p>In our high-stakes accountability system, schools and colleges yet again find themselves victims of more shifting expectations, retrospective announcements and that familiar sense of people making things up as they go along.</p>

"342461","Super or not? Teachers wake up to a NEU dawn","/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/super-or-not-teachers-wake-a-neu-dawn","Following the ATL/NUT mega-merger, Tes finds out what it means for the unions’ members","<p>The birth of a new teaching “superunion” was announced last week.</p>

<p>In the august setting of the British Library, Mary Bousted and Kevin Courtney, general secretaries of the ATL and NUT teaching unions respectively, revealed that their members had voted to come together to form a new entity: the National Education Union (NEU).</p>

<p>Will it re-empower education trade unions and influence government policy? Or will the new union be shouting from the sidelines? <em>Tes</em> answers the crucial questions.</p>

<h2><font color=""ED3340"">How big will the NEU be?</font></h2>

<p>The NEU will certainly be an impressive size. According to the latest official figures, the NUT had 333,704 paying members in 2015, while the ATL had 123,054.</p>

<p>That should bring together more than 450,000 members at the NEU – making it the biggest education union in Europe and the fourth largest in the TUC.</p>

<p>The superunion will be comfortably larger than the NASUWT teaching union, which had 284,990 paying members in 2015 and has for years competed with the NUT for the title of biggest education union.</p>

<h2><font color=""ED3340"">Will it be more effective at influencing government policy?</font></h2>

<p>Its leaders certainly think so. Bousted – who will be joint secretary of the NEU with Courtney – says that the move will be a “game changer”.</p>

<p>In a joint interview with the two leaders in Tes last month, Courtney said that the NEU’s larger size would translate into increased power. The union will be “speaking for a majority of all teachers” and “politicians will have to listen”, he said.</p>

<p>But others disagree. Chris Keates, general secretary of NASUWT, which has been fiercely protective of the union’s independent identity, has previously said that it was “better” for ministers to receive six letters from unions on issues such as pay, than to be sent one letter with six signatures.</p>

<p>However, Professor Richard Hyman, an industrial-relations expert at the London School of Economics, says that he does not “buy” Keates’ argument, instead believing that trade union fragmentation usually favours “the other side”.</p>

<p>“If the [fragmented] French unions write to the government, it looks bad if they don’t all sign,” he says.</p>

<p>“If the one confederation in Germany writes to the government, I suspect it has a rather more powerful voice.”</p>

<h2><font color=""ED3340"">Is dialogue with government more or less likely?</font></h2>

<p>Bousted and Courtney have said that they want to work with the Department for Education. They cite Justine Greening’s defence of qualified teacher status as evidence that the education secretary will be more willing to listen to their concerns than her predecessors. However, the union’s list of grievances – which includes the academies system, Ofsted, workload and school funding, to mention a few – suggests that amity between the DfE and NEU is unlikely to suddenly break out.</p>

<p>Prime minister Theresa May’s determination to reintroduce grammar schools has already put the government and the NEU on a collision course. The leaders of the new union have pledged to fight the expansion of academic selection.</p>

<p>Courtney says that the NEU will reach out to “unusual allies”, such as grammarsceptic Conservative politicians, to try to stop the government in its tracks.</p>

<h2><font color=""ED3340"">What does the change mean for industrial action?</font></h2>

<p>The ATL is seen as less willing to strike than the NUT, although Bousted notes that the union took two days of national action in 2013 over pensions and recently supported striking teaching-assistant members in Durham.</p>

<p>However, when it comes to the likelihood of the NEU engaging in industrial action, recent legal changes will be more decisive than the composition of the new union.</p>

<p>The 2016 Trade Union Act means that for certain public services, including education, 50 per cent of all members must return their ballot papers and 40 per cent of members must vote “yes” before national industrial action can take place.</p>

<p>“You won’t get national industrial action unless there’s a major, major issue that teachers or members feel so strongly about,” Bousted says.</p>

<p>This isn’t to say industrial action won’t take place, but it is likely to take a different form. “It will probably be more locally based around MATs, or around particular schools and around particular issues,” she adds.</p>

<h2><font color=""ED3340"">What challenges will the NEU have to grapple with?</font></h2>

<p>Hyman says that union mergers can “involve difficulties”, particularly when organisations with “very different union cultures, very different traditions of decision-making” are brought together.</p>

<p>When Unison was formed in 1993 from three public sector trade unions, he says it took the organisation “about a decade for the thing to work and for the effectiveness to outweigh some of the dysfunction”.</p>

<p>He says that the NEU’s chances of long-term success would be improved if the union could “chalk up” some early victories.</p>

<p>“If they can get some sort of favourable treatment in terms of what is seen as key issues, then that will help,” he says. “If the government maintains the screws…and they can’t respond, it will be harder. That would, I think, encourage more internal conflict.”</p>

<p>At least the NEU’s joint general secretaries are aware of the risks. “We aren’t going to be inward-looking in these first few years,” says Courtney. “We’ve read the literature around union mergers and we know that can happen.”</p>

<h2><font color=""ED3340"">Could members disaffected with the merger leave?</font></h2>

<p>There was a noticeable difference between the ATL and NUT ballot results. While 97.2 per cent of NUT members voted for the merger and only 2.8 per cent against, for the ATL, the figure was 72.8 per cent for and 26.8 per cent against.</p>

<p>Bousted says that support was lower in her union because, unlike the NUT, the ATL had not had a “long policy of professional unity”. She also said it was always a “bigger ask” for the smaller union in a merger to gain support from its members.</p>

<p>With more than 20,000 independent sector members, the ATL does exhibit cultural differences to the NUT and it is clear that some of these teachers are not happy with the formation of the new union.</p>

<p>Mike Rye, a history teacher at the independent Italia Conti Academy in London, who voted against the merger, says that he joined the ATL because it was “committed to not striking”. Rye adds that members had been “bombarded with propaganda to vote ‘yes’” by the ATL’s leadership, and claims that the low turnout of only 25 per cent suggests “a silent majority” in the union opposed the merger. He says that he will “almost certainly go elsewhere” following the merger and will probably move to Voice.</p>

<p>However, other independent school members unhappy with the move are taking a “wait and see” approach. Tim Day, a boarding housemaster at an independent school (see box, above), says that while he “might look at NASUWT”, he will “stick it out for now and see what happens”.</p>

<h2><font color=""ED3340"">What will the NEU’s finances be like following the merger?</font></h2>

<p>Bousted says that the ATL and NUT are “both extremely financially stable”, and that the amalgamation was not pursued for financial reasons. She says that the ATL had made operating surpluses for the past five years, including a half-a-million-pound surplus this year.</p>

<p>She says that the new organisation will be able to unleash efficiencies by merging its financial, IT and HR resources. By no longer having to compete with each other on recruitment, the NEU will also be able to spend more on services for members and campaigning, Bousted adds.</p>

<p>The ATL and NUT both own valuable real estate in central London, but Bousted says that there is currently no plan to move to a single location.</p>

<h2><font color=""ED3340"">What differences will teachers see in their schools?</font></h2>

<p>The NEU will be launched in a phased approach, so members are unlikely to see an immediate change on the ground. A transitional phase will start in September, with separate ATL and NUT sections existing until national rules for the new organisation come into effect on 1 January 2019.</p>

<p>However, the unions have promised members that, by combining their resources, they will be able to offer better services, including higher-quality continual professional development. They have also said that the NEU will increase the chance of teachers having a local representative in their school.</p>

"342527","On the marriage of minds – and mindless acronyms","/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/marriage-minds-and-mindless-acronyms","","<p>As Ferret noted earlier this month, new chief inspector Amanda Spielman’s first FE speech marked a “reset” in the relationship between Ofsted and the sector. So the inspectorate can now breathe a sigh of relief and take it easy, right?</p>

<p>Well, not exactly. For starters, there are going to be plenty of new providers for inspectors to keep an eye on. As of this month, the new Register of Apprenticeship Training Providers (even for a sector plagued with awful acronyms, RoATP is pretty damn excruciating) boasts 1,708 providers given the green light to deliver to large, levy-paying employers.</p>

<p>Ofsted’s deputy director for FE and skills, Paul Joyce, confirmed to <em>Tes</em> that it would be sticking with its current policy of inspecting all new providers within three years – that’s a lot of inspections to squeeze in.</p>

<p>FErret has also heard that the watchdog is still hoping to press ahead with its plans to introduce separate campus-level grades for colleges, to allow for local accountability. But Ofsted is reliant on receiving additional funding from the Department for Education to cover the increasing costs that this would cause.</p>

<p>Given that the DfE already has a host of apprenticeship reforms, the introduction of T levels, the new schools funding formula and the small, uncontroversial matter of grammar schools to contend with, FErret can’t help but fear that the matter of campus grades may be disappearing to the bottom of stressed civil servants’ to-do lists for the foreseeable future.</p>

<h2><font color=""F26522"">Wedding march of progress</font></h2>

<p>Tuesday 28 March 2017 will go down as one of the happiest days in FErret’s life. It was the day that FE’s two star-cross’d lovers finally became one.</p>

<p>Yes, after months of anxious preparations, the Skills Funding Agency (SFA) and Education Funding Agency (EFA) have finally tied the knot.</p>

<p>Frankly, if colleges have been forced into loveless marriages to save a few quid, it’s about time that the bodies funding them did the same.</p>

<p>Clearly neither party wanted to lose its name so, with a tedious sense of inevitability, the new organisation will be known as the Education and Skills Funding Agency. Sigh. In any case: congratulations to everyone concerned. Here’s hoping for lifetime filled with laughter, RoATPs and UKPRNs.</p>

<p>Chris Jones received pay and benefits worth a total of £690,471 in 2016 – up by 60 per cent on the £431,783 emoluments he received in 2015, according to the group's financial statements for 2015-16.</p>

<p>In 2016, Mr Jones received a salary of £259,500, taxable benefits worth £46,375 (including car allowance and ""cash in lieu of pension"")  and a cash bonus of £107,367. He also received a lump sum of £277,229 under a long-term incentive plan. This, according to the document, covers the “three years ended August 2016 and amounts to 36 per cent of salary per year of the [payment] plan”.</p>

<p>Mr Jones’ package was almost double the salary of the best-paid college principal, according to the most recent official figures. In 2014-15, Sunaina Mann, then principal and chief executive of the North East Surrey College of Technology (Nescot) Group, was <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-news/principals-pay-drops-colleges-feel-pinch"">paid £363,000</a>. She left the role in June 2016. According to the 2015-16 annual accounts, the best-paid academies leader was Sir Daniel Moynihan, CEO of the Harris Federation of schools. He was <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/academy-accounts-executive-pay-continues-rise"">paid between £420,000 and £425,000</a>.</p>

<p>In December, the unions representing college staff agreed a <strong>1</strong><a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-news/college-strike-averted-after-unions-accept-1-pay-rise""><strong> per cent pay rise</strong> </a>with the Association of Colleges.</p>

<h2><strong>'Impact on FE budgets'</strong></h2>

<p>The City and Guilds Group – a registered charity – comprises vocational awarding body City and Guilds, as well as sister companies ILM, Kineo, The Oxford Group, Digitalme and e3Learning.</p>

<p>Janet Clark, the ATL teaching union's education policy adviser, said: “ATL is concerned about the impact [high salaries at awarding bodies] will have on FE budgets, which are already stretched.</p>

<p>“Adult education budgets have already been cut by around 35 per cent over the last six years. To have this amount of money going from colleges to an awarding organisation is going to have a big impact.”</p>

<p>Mr Jones joined the group in 2008, having previous held roles at LexisNexis, Pearson and Reed Elsevier. According to the company’s website: “Since joining in 2008, he has led the City and Guilds Group through a period of significant growth, which has enabled further investment in the organisation.”</p>

<h2><strong>'We need to attract good senior executives'</strong></h2>

<p>A City and Guilds Group spokesperson said Mr Jones' base salary was unchanged since January 2015, and that the £277,000 payment under the long-term incentive plan was<em> </em>""a core part of our executive reward package"".<em> </em></p>

<p>The spokesperson added: ""Fifty-six per cent of his total reward was based on the successful delivery of performance-related targets, as set by the trustees of the City amd Guilds Group. This year’s long-term improvement plan (LTIP) has paid out because the three-year growth targets were met. It has been incrementally accounted for over the past three years but only paid out in August 2016. The last LTIP did not pay out as targets were not met. </p>

<p>""The trustees believe that we need to be able to attract and retain senior executives with the right levels of experience and the right capabilities to enable the group’s future growth. Chris Jones is responsible for running a set of successful businesses across over 100 international markets. Over the past few years, our strategy has focused on diversifying away from publicly funded markets, and approximately a third of our revenue now comes from non-publicly funded markets, such as elearning and corporate training delivery. </p>

<p>""The governance of executive reward sits with the remuneration committee. This committee consists of trustees, with input from external specialist advisers. The committee is accountable directly to the full trustee board. It works to a set of best-practice principles to determine and approve executive remuneration, including annual bonuses and long-term incentive plans.""</p>

<p>Existing contracts held by current providers will instead by extended until the end of the year to “maintain stability in the system”, the ESFA said in a <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/news/procurement-for-apprenticeship-training-in-smaller-employers"">statement published today</a>.</p>

<p>This procurement had been ""markedly oversubscribed"", the ESFA said, adding that the change would enable it to review its approach and ensure it achieved “the right balance between stability of supply and promoting competition and choice for employers”.</p>

<p>Existing contracts held by all current providers will be extended until the end of December 2017. “The ESFA will notify providers of specific arrangements shortly so that amended contracts are in place ahead of 1 May,” said the statement.</p>

<h2>'Right for the apprenticeship programme'</h2>

<p>Mark Dawe, chief executive of the Association of Employment and Learning Providers, said the group fully supported the government’s welcome announcement, which was “right for the sector and right for the apprenticeship programme”. </p>

<p>“It clearly shows that the government is as serious about the quality of the programme and the social mobility benefits of apprenticeships as it is about hitting the three million target,"" he added.</p>

<p>""The decision also gives the new providers on the register more time to prepare their offer for non-levy paying employers. But more importantly, existing providers can continue to support their employers and start new apprentices while a more considered review of anticipated programme demand takes place in the context of the <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-views/fe-must-have-a-voice-industrial-strategy-consultation"">industrial strategy</a> and the <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-views/post-brexit-britain-needs-further-education"">skills implications of Brexit</a>.”</p>

<h2>Time to refine the process</h2>

<p>He added that some providers would be frustrated by the announcement, “but the programme’s reputation will be better served by this rethink of the government’s approach.""</p>

<p>And David Hughes, chief executive at the Association of Colleges, said the ESFA’s decision was “a sensible and helpful recognition of the scale and complexity of change which is happening at the moment”.</p>

<p>“This provides welcome stability to colleges and providers as well as to employers and apprentices through the coming months; this will give more time to get the procurement process right,"" he added.</p>

<p>""We know that there are many new providers wanting to enter the apprenticeship market, but the government needs to find a way to ensure that their introduction does not inadvertently undermine current high quality, trusted colleges and providers that have built strong employer relationships over many years and for which apprenticeships are a key opportunity for progression for their students.""</p>

<p>The NASUWT teaching union will question members who work in schools that have been included in the government's flagship <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/schools-receive-£6bn-repair-crumbling-buildings""><strong>Priority Schools Building Programme (PSBP)</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Wayne Bates, a national negotiating officer, says the union has heard “a lot of stories about very poor-quality rebuilding, and teachers not being happy with things like corridor width and the size of classrooms”. He adds: “It’s two issues: we have got, perhaps, rebuilds that are not big enough, but we also have these schools that are bursting at the seams.”</p>

<p>There have also been concerns about sites that have been found for some <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/free-school""><strong>free schools</strong></a>.</p>

<p>When councillors were considering the planning application for Bolingbroke Academy, which opened in 2012 in the grade II-listed home of the former Bolingbroke Hospital in Wandsworth, southwest London, the chief concern was that “the site was not large enough for the proposed school to accommodate up to 800 pupils”. The secondary now has a regime of seated breaktimes for Year 7 pupils. </p>

<p>Parents have been told that the school must have such arrangements because of space constraints.</p>

<p>The school, which is sponsored by Ark, declined to comment, but its website acknowledges that it has “limited internal play space” and that it uses staggered breaktimes to “enable pupils to make good use of it”.</p>

<p>A DfE spokesperson said a <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/billions-needed-restore-school-buildings-satisfactory-condition-warns""><strong>National Audit Office report</strong></a> published in February had suggested that school leaders are “overwhelmingly satisfied” with their PSBP schools.</p>

<p>“Of the 53 school leaders that have fed back, 85 per cent have been satisfied, or better, with their buildings. We will shortly be seeking similar feedback on free schools,” he said.</p>

<p>“Schools are designed to support educational attainment with robust buildings that are simple to operate and with low ongoing running costs. For free schools, we will open in high-quality temporary sites where appropriate, and we make sure that they are safe and suitable for educational purposes.”</p>

"346309","'We need to help students bridge the gap between school and college study'","/news/further-education/breaking-views/we-need-help-students-bridge-gap-between-school-and-college","New FE learners need to be able to manage their time and work independently – and these skills don’t grow naturally in the summer holidays, says Matt Bromley","<p>Last year, I wrote a book on transition. Like most literature on this subject, it focused on <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/transition-isnt-just-a-matter-first-term-impact-can-last-years"">pupils’ transfer from primary to secondary school</a>, as well as between the various years and key stages of compulsory schooling. But, in working with FE colleges across the country, it’s struck me just how important the transition from school to FE is and just how unprepared students are to make this change.</p>

<p>A common mistake that FE teachers make, particularly when planning assignments, is to assume that in the six weeks between leaving school and starting college students have – somehow, somewhere – acquired an armoury of study skills and, perhaps by a process of osmosis, become adept at working independently. Study skills are not innate; they must be taught – and this is about making the implicit explicit, the invisible visible.</p>

<p>Teaching study skills is about breaking down complex processes into their constituent parts, modelling each element, then providing multiple <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/instead-caging-learning-lectures-can-set-it-free"">opportunities for students</a> to practise and refine them.</p>

<h2>We must teach students the tactics of independence</h2>

<p>For example, if an assignment requires students to research information for an essay, we must explicitly teach them how to use multiple sources, skim and scan for key facts and distinguish between fact and opinion and detect bias. We must then teach them how to use evidence to support an argument, including how to embed quotations and write a bibliography citing their sources.</p>

<p>If we expect students to work independently, perhaps drafting and redrafting work based on feedback, and to do so outside of lessons without our support, we must teach them how to manage and organise their time, revise (avoiding cramming by distributing and spacing practice, and interleaving topics), and how to self-assess then redraft, referring back to the success criteria.</p>

<p>If we expect students to engage in classroom debates, we must teach them active listening skills and turn-taking, as well as how to agree or disagree with someone else’s contributions without it becoming personal.</p>

<p>If we expect students to adopt a growth mindset, willingly accepting and acting on feedback, taking risks and regarding mistakes as an integral part of the <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-views/mass-lectures-could-save-colleges-money-and-boost-learning"">learning process</a>, then we must teach and model resilience.</p>

<h2><strong>Ongoing development</strong></h2>

<p>Explicitly teaching and modelling study skills is certainly one means of bridging the gap between school and college, but we shouldn’t just teach skills at the start of a student’s first year. Instead, we should teach skills on a sliding scale <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-views/ex-students-are-everywhere"">as students progress</a> from one year to the next and from one level of qualification to the next.</p>

<p>For example, although we might start by teaching students how to write a simple bibliography, as they progress towards level 3 and HE programmes, we must move on to Harvard referencing.</p>

<p>A useful starting point when planning the teaching of skills is to map the skills students need and when they need them.</p>

<p>This should be done for every programme and for every level of qualification, noting the difference between a skill required by a student at level 1 and a similar skill – albeit more developed and complex – that may be required at levels 2 and 3.</p>

"347080","'Mary Bousted, you're dead wrong about free schools'","/news/school-news/breaking-views/mary-bousted-youre-dead-wrong-about-free-schools","Free school founder and champion Toby Young responds to Mary Bousted's damning critique of the free school programme ","<p>I was disappointed to read <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/free-school-programme-badly-run-poorly-conceived-and-a-waste-public"">Mary Bousted’s unpleasant and divisive article about free schools.</a> I wonder if she paused for a second to think about the impact of her words on the thousands of teachers who work at free schools and whom, in many cases, have helped set them up?</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/approval-granted-131-more-free-schools"">Two-thirds of free schools have been established by groups led by teachers</a>, many of them members of the ATL or the NUT teaching unions. It cannot be great for morale to know that the soon-to-be joint leader of your union thinks the school you have been pouring your heart into is an example of “our worst fears realised”.</p>

<p>Mary has the gall to characterise anyone who questions her objections to free schools as indulging in “post-truth” politics, and, in the next breath, implies that free schools are more likely to be closed than other schools. In fact, in the last five years 1.71 per cent of maintained schools have closed, compared to just 1.43 per cent of free schools. If Mary is genuinely concerned about the impact of school closures on children, that would be a reason to support the free schools programme, where the rate of attrition is below average, not oppose it.</p>

<p>Mary claims that “too many free schools” have “become mired” in <a href=""http://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/gcses-almost-third-free-schools-below-floor-standard"">“educational underperformance”</a>, overlooking the fact that the externally validated test results of free schools are above average. To take just one example, in the free school sixth forms that posted <a href=""http://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/yesterdays-progress-8-numbers-point-a-rosy-future-free-schools"">A-level results last year, 27.8 per cent of pupils got AAB or better</a>, compared to a national average of 19.9 per cent.</p>

<p>One of the schools responsible for this astonishing achievement is the London Academy of Excellence in Newham, the fourth most deprived borough in London, whose students are currently sitting on 20 offers from Oxford and Cambridge. </p>

<p>Mary dwells on “free school failures”, but <a href=""http://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/free-school-recovers-fraud-and-teacher-stabbing-win-outstanding"">29 per cent have been rated ""outstanding"" by Ofsted</a>, compared to a national average of 21 per cent and just 19 per cent of the council-run schools so beloved of the teaching unions; only seven free schols in total are currently ""inadequate"". Even if you count university technical colleges and studio schools as free schools, which critics of the programme are keen to do, the percentage that are ""outstanding"" is still above average (25 per cent).</p>

<p>On and on she goes, regurgitating the fake news the teaching unions have been pumping out about free schools since their inception.</p>

<p>She claims that free schools are “prohibitively expensive” and create “surplus places” – those old chestnuts – invoking the “Conservative-dominated” Public Accounts Committee as a witness for the prosecution. </p>

<p>In fact, free schools cost nearly a third less per square metre than new schools built under Labour’s Building Schools for the Future programme (<a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/psbp-overview/priority-school-building-programme-overview"">according to the National Audit Office</a>) and over 80 per cent of free schools opened or approved to open since 2014 are in areas where there is a demographic need for more places (<a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/320775/Wave_6_free_schools_basic_need.pdf"">according to the DfE</a>).</p>

<p>As for the Public Accounts Committee report, Mary neglects to mention that the PAC is led by the Labour MP Meg Hillier and she rushed out the document in question alongside seven other reports over a 48-hour period, leaving the Conservative members of the committee with very little time to read it. It was a piece of Labour Party electioneering, not a serious contribution to the debate about school funding.</p>

<p>Finally, Mary says she would like to see free schools and academies placed under local authority control as if everything was rosy before the evil Michael Gove started exposing our public education system to “the vagaries of the market”. </p>

<p>But she is ignoring the fact that there are 1.8 million more children being educated at ""good"" or ""outstanding"" schools today than there were in 2010, even though two-thirds of secondaries and one fifth of primaries are now academies. </p>

<p>It is also worth noting that the number of children from <a href=""http://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/disadvantaged-a-level-pupils-offered-free-tuition-help-get-university"">disadvantaged backgrounds going to university is higher in England today, </a>after seven years of Conservative education secretaries, than ever before.</p>

<p>And if local authorities are such marvellous custodians of taxpayer-funded schools, how can Mary explain why <a href=""http://dera.ioe.ac.uk/21953/1/doc_4690.pdf"">a fifth of children left school in 2009 unable to read, write or add up</a>? That was a piece of data uncovered by a team of researchers from the University of Sheffield commissioned by the last Labour government. Not coincidentally, the same is true of Scotland today, which has staunchly resisted the education reforms south of the border.</p>

<p>No doubt Mary would like the English school system to be more like that of Wales, which has been run by Labour since 2003. No academies, no free schools, not even any league tables. Hooray! <a href=""http://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/waving-flag-wales-we-need-celebrate-uniqueness-welsh-education"">Yet Wales is, by some distance, the lowest-performing region in the UK,</a> having been level-pegging with England 15 years ago.</p>

<p>No, Mary, it is not “post-truth” to describe your objections to free schools as “ideological and backward-looking”. It was the only true thing in your article.</p>

"347560","To stay fresh as a teacher in FE, don’t sweat the big stuff","/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/stay-fresh-a-teacher-fe-dont-sweat-big-stuff","As one college-veteran friend retires, ground down by the system, another arrives wide-eyed and excited – a timely reminder of how invigorating the work can and should be","<p>I’m concerned that I’m approaching my teacher best before date. I stumbled into this FE thing because one of my friends, a 30-year FE veteran, guided me toward the profession she loved, when I had hit a low patch in my life. I was highly suggestible in that vulnerable state and did as I was told, obediently signing on to a level 5 diploma course at my local FE college. I often wonder where I’d be now if she’d been a nurse or a lawyer.</p>

<p>In the nine years since, my friend, one of the most and skilled teachers I have ever known, took voluntary redundancy. Area reviews led to her sprawling college merging with another, even bigger one, and as the clattering mayhem reached a crescendo, she wanted out.</p>

<p>She is no longer a champion of the sector and sees it as a dismal failure.</p>

<p>She believes that its place as a political afterthought has created a landscape of clueless corporate managerialism. She says that this, twinned with untenable funding cuts, has removed the ability for those of us on the front line to do our jobs. She believes the biggest victims of this abuse are the students.</p>

<p>I’ll be honest, her stance – which I don’t necessarily disagree with – has put a strain on our relationship. There are vast no-go areas of conversation.</p>

<p>I feel far more optimistic about the sector. That said, my rose-tinted specs have long since been replaced with a pair of prescription lenses and I can see clearly. But is sharp focus the most helpful thing to have when some aspects of our profession are based on, if not a suspension of disbelief, certainly a suspension of logic? My friend is right. There isn’t enough time or money for us to do our jobs properly. Does “making the best of it” demonstrate resilience or consent to victimhood?</p>

<p>I am concerned for myself. While I delight in my community-education role, I’ve felt jaded about the whole FE college thing for a while. My knackeredold-bag status is even clearer to me thanks to a colleague’s attitude to her work.</p>

<p>She’s a brand new FE teacher, excited about pedagogical discovery and eager to experiment with what she is learning. She is compassionate, seeing the best in students, even when that best is heavily and purposefully cloaked. She works the longest hours, even though she is no doubt on the lowest rung of remuneration. She is what I was, and holds an unflattering mirror to what I have become.</p>

<p>I don’t want to be one of those festering moaners who should have long since hung up her lanyard. I still have so much to learn and I believe I have a lot left to give. My challenge is to find a way to rekindle the desire to enthusiastically participate. To get excited about being a small cog in a vast college machine. To carry on, I know I need to cast off creeping disillusionment over the big stuff and concentrate on what drew me into the profession. I think the answer might be education. My own.</p>

"347572","Schools are just one piece of the mental health puzzle","/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/schools-are-just-one-piece-mental-health-puzzle","Tackling anxiety, depression, panic disorder, phobia or obsessive-compulsive disorde in schools starts with understanding the causes","<p>Last November, I sat on a panel with the president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, Sir Simon Wessely.</p>

<p>At the time, the government-funded Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey 2016 had recently revealed that 26 per cent of women aged 16 to 24 had anxiety, depression, panic disorder, phobia or obsessive-compulsive disorder. The professor confirmed these statistics, but also went on to say that it was utterly unclear what had caused the increase.</p>

<p>Certainly, I have come to understand that the rise in the number of students with mental health problems is a multifactorial issue. And while there are numerous reasons for this, I would argue that there are three key ones:</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><font color=""512984"">Funding cuts</font></h2>

<p>Cuts to children and young people’s mental health services have compounded the impact of the reduction in school budgets generally. As the government reduces school budgets by 8 per cent in real terms over the course of this Parliament, school leaders have to prioritise spending; it is the student support mechanisms on the periphery of the budget spreadsheet that are often the first to be sacrificed.</p>

<h2><font color=""512984"">Academic challenge</font></h2>

<p>A greater focus on the level of academic challenge that schools provide has meant an increase in the number of terminal exams and, some would say, a rise in the difficulty of those exams. Increased academic challenge is arguably welcome, but in the context of reduced budgets, performance-related pay and a raft of uncoordinated, rapid changes in education, it has been difficult to prepare students securely for the greater academic challenges that they are expected to face.</p>

<h2><font color=""512984"">Social media</font></h2>

<p>The effect of social media upon our children’s world is a factor that is making our school environments increasingly stressful. Most arguments between students now seem to have their roots in who said what about whom on Facebook or Instagram the night before. As the powers of this technology grow, middleaged teachers, who are supposed to deal with the negative effects, are increasingly being left behind.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>While it helps to understand the causes, it ultimately can’t be the job of school leaders to tackle these factors head-on. We don’t have that kind of power. Instead, we must get on with the business of supporting young people as best we can and providing them with strategies to manage their own mental health.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/new-tory-pledges-school-admissions-review-lower-ebacc-target-and""><strong>Tory manifesto</strong></a> says official research shows that “slightly more children from ordinary, working class families attend selective schools as a percentage of the school intake compared to non-selective schools”.</p>

<p>However, Alice Sullivan, head of the department of quantitative social science at the UCL Institute of Education, described this claim as “staggering” and “clearly false”.</p>

<p>She said it was only reached by excluding poorer families from the definition of “ordinary, working class families”.</p>

<p>“Very far from producing evidence-based policy, they are flying in the face of all the evidence we have,” she said. “Even more shockingly, they are using quite clear sleight of hand to misrepresent the evidence and claim that grammar schools are taking their share of ordinary working class kids.”</p>

<p>Becky Francis, director of the UCL Institute of Education was speaking at the same event: a media conference held by Education Media Centre, in Central London. She criticised Conservative plans for more universities and private schools to sponsor academies or set up free schools.</p>

<p>She said: “There is really no evidence that the input of universities and private schools as sponsors is going to help raise quality here. There has been an incredibly mixed picture.”</p>

<p>And Becky Allen, director of Education Datalab described the Conservative pledge to bar councils from creating new places at schools rated ‘inadequate’ or ‘requires improvement’ as “infeasible”.</p>

<p>She said this was because some of the need was driven by “very, very short term” demographic pressures, and setting up new free schools takes a long time.</p>

<p>The Conservative Party has been contacted for comment.</p>

<p>Dr Allen described <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/teacher-sabbaticals-promised-labour"">Labour’s plans</a>, meanwhile,<strong> </strong>as essentially a “manifesto for teachers”.</p>

<p>She said this was “no bad thing”, as the absolute constraint on getting a better education system now was constraints in the teacher labour market.</p>

<p>However, she added: “I don’t think [Labour] has a coherent vision of what sort of education they’d like for children. When I read this manifesto, it’s hard for me to understand what kind of material changes to the experience of children, particularly in the classroom, they want to see happen.”</p>

<p>She said the <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/ten-ways-lib-dems-want-improve-schools""><strong>Liberal Democrat manifesto</strong></a> pledges on reducing political control over the curriculum, slimming down on the core curriculum, and Sats reform, would have “a material impact on the experience of children in the classroom”.</p>

<p>However, she said that while they had “lovely policies” on professional development of existing teachers, they had “nothing” to deal with “the critical problem” of teacher recruitment.</p>

But for many people, where they place their mark is the final act of a complex decision-making process. And a Tes poll has revealed how heavily schools policy will weigh in teachers’ calculations ahead of next week’s general election.</p>

<p>In the survey of more than 1,200 primary, secondary and special school teachers, 70 per cent of respondents said parties’ schools policies were “very important” in deciding how they vote, with a further 25 per cent saying they were “quite important”.</p>

<p>The poll gives Labour a 58 percentage point lead over the second-placed Liberal Democrats, with the Conservatives another 2 percentage points behind.</p>

<p>While the findings of the snap online survey might not mirror the actual percentage split in next week’s vote among teachers, it does point to a definite trend: teachers are making a big switch to Labour.</p>

<p>In the survey, 51 per cent of teachers said they voted Labour at the 2015 election. But when the same teachers were asked about their voting intentions for the 2017 ballot, that proportion increased to 68 per cent.</p>

<p>The Conservatives’ loss was greater than that of the Liberal Democrats, with support for the Greens and Ukip also falling. The environmentalists saw their share drop from 7 per cent to 3 per cent, while Ukip declined from 1.4 per cent to just 0.3 per cent.</p>

<p>The shift to Labour was greater among secondary teachers, rising from 52 per cent to 72 per cent, compared with 50 per cent to 65 per cent among primary teachers. The change was smallest among special school teachers, up from 47 per cent to 53 per cent.</p>

<p>The importance that teachers place on politicians’ plans for schools appears to play a big role in the swing to Labour. When asked which party has the best education policies or track record, almost three quarters opted for Jeremy Corbyn’s party.</p>

<h2>Optimism in short supply</h2>

<p>But teachers are not optimistic about the future: 75 per cent do not believe schools will be improved as a result of the election.</p>

<p>“Funding cuts have already hit schools hard,” one secondary teacher responded. “Even if more money is pumped into education, it will take years to rebuild.”</p>

<p>For John Tomsett, headteacher at Huntington School in York, it is school funding that is driving teachers towards Labour.</p>

<p>“I would say that in the lead up to 2015, education was off the agenda, as both main parties knew there would be funding cuts whoever got in,” he says. “It was not on the agenda. Although there were quite a few rumblings across the country, it was not hitting the classroom. It was at the headteacher level at that point. I think what has happened in the last two years is that people are realising it’s for real. The heads are not joking: ‘I used to have text books; my class has gone up from 27 to 32…’”</p>

<p>It is a view shared by Mary Bousted, general secretary of the ATL teaching union, who highlights the role of its School Cuts website – a co-venture with the NUT teaching union. She says: “That’s really galvanised people – £3 billion of school cuts is a big figure, but no one knows what it means. When you enter your school [on the site] and see it means thousands of pounds, it’s something different.”</p>

<p>Mark Lehain, founder and principal of the Bedford Free School in Bedford, describes the unions’ school funding campaign as “naughty” for conflating the funding formula with the general squeeze. But he admits it has “cut through” and helped drive the shift to Labour among teachers.</p>

<p>“This election campaign has come out of nowhere and has rocked up in the middle of the campaign against what unions claim are cuts,” adds Lehain, a policy fellow at right-leaning thinktank Policy Exchange. “I would imagine that has a lot to do with it.”</p>

<p>He also believes that those who support the Conservative reforms of the past seven years are now free to vote for other parties, safe in the knowledge that the other main parties would leave the reforms largely intact.</p>

","<p>Voting could hardly be easier: you write a cross beside a person’s name on a piece of paper and put it in a box. But for many people, where they place their mark is the final act of a complex decision-making process. And a Tes poll has revealed how heavily schools policy will weigh in teachers’ calculations ahead of next week’s general election.</p>

"349006","Can you be faithful to research and your pupils?","/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/can-you-be-faithful-research-and-your-pupils","In the latest in a series of columns, Philippa Cordingley explains how to use others’ research faithfully while staying true to your own professional judgement","<p>Using other people’s research is an exacting professional skill. It can be hard to step out of your comfort zone and try something new. As Charles Desforges, who first debunked the learning styles myth, argues: “The pull of the status quo in teaching is very strong.""</p>

<p>And teachers also need opportunities to use their professional judgement to adapt research-based interventions to meet the specific needs of their pupils.</p>

<p>How far, then, should they strive to be faithful to the original research? And how far can they adapt things without potentially jeopardising the use of research in the first place?</p>

<p>Let’s look at a couple of widespread examples. Owing to time pressures, many research lesson study (RLS) triads miss out the final dissemination stage. Does that mean the results can’t be used to judge the effectiveness of RLS?</p>

<p>Similarly, the complexity of synthetic phonics makes it easy to omit a tiny element such as getting pupils to point to a finger as they sound out phonemes to demonstrate that they’ve understood the basic structure. Does this shortcut mean it is not legitimate use of research?</p>

<h2>Making adaptations</h2>

<p>While teachers must have the chance to make professional judgements about using research, this has to happen in phases and depends on trying out interventions as specified a couple of times first before making adaptations.</p>

<p>Here are three helpful ground rules:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>1. </strong>Remember that an intervention backed by good evidence is unlikely to include unnecessary steps. Asking pupils to touch their fingertips with each sound may seem pointless, but the importance of these visual clues about learning might only be apparent once you have taken a step back and observed your pupils closely.</li>
	<li><strong>2.</strong> Although research reports recommending an intervention may look alien, remember that they derive from the work of teachers and the learning efforts of lots of pupils. This might help to make sense of them in the early stages.</li>
	<li><strong>3. </strong>Bear in mind that when using new research, you won’t yet know what you don’t know about it. It is only through trialling an intervention in its entirety that we can understand how we might streamline the process to suit our pupils’ needs without losing elements that are essential to effectiveness. So rather than adapting an intervention from the outset, stick to the design initially and then streamline the approach gradually in the light of evidence from early experiments.</li>
</ul>

<p>This process allows us to strike the right balance between fidelity to research and fidelity to the professional judgement of teachers.</p>

"349726","Treat us like part-timers, expect a part-time effort","/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/treat-us-part-timers-expect-a-part-time-effort","Being left out of meetings, emails and celebrations can easily erode commitment","<p>Over 50 per cent of the workforce in general FE colleges are part-timers. It’s that flexibility that allowed me to enter the sector when my son was small, scheduling sessional hours around childcare. Over the years, I’ve worked on a part-time basis at five colleges, but how connected I’ve felt to those institutions has varied greatly.</p>

<p>I’ve had some brilliant experiences where small gestures and thoughtful organisational routines have helped me feel just as included as those who spend all day, every day in one workplace. I’ve also taught at colleges where I’ve felt like a visitor. Guess which organisations I’ve felt more loyal towards and most compelled to work hard for.</p>

<p>None of the less welcoming conditions I’ve encountered have been that way through malice – it’s just institutionalised carelessness from overworked management. But teacher retention is such a big issue that setting the right tone to get the best from part-time staff must surely be right up the priority list.</p>

<p>Making staff, all staff, feel like they belong is not just good manners, it’s good business. Going the extra mile for the students comes naturally to teachers, it’s what we do. But going the extra mile for the college is a big ask if, as a part-timer, you don’t feel like you’re perceived to be a member of the pack.</p>

<h3>A place to call home</h3>

<p>Hot-desking is appropriate in some college areas, but teachers use the staffroom not just to work, but also as a place of sanctuary after a difficult class. It may not be possible to give desk space to all part-time colleagues, but a desk time-share can work well. It’s a place to call their work-home.</p>

<p>The same goes for storage space. It seems obvious that a member of teaching staff would need somewhere to stash their resources and their students’ work. But with many staffrooms stuffed to capacity, it often means that a colleague will have to surrender a shelf. Perhaps frame it as an opportunity to declutter.</p>

<h3>Inclusive team meetings</h3>

<p>Making it possible for all teachers to attend their team’s regular meetings is essential. Ring-fenced time to discuss departmental issues or concerns about students, as well as a spot of informal good-practice sharing, allows for a more united team. A weekly team meeting scheduled for the same day each week, just because “that’s what we’ve always done”, excludes part-timers. But it is easily remedied.</p>

<p>Staggering the day that the weekly team meetings are held solves the problem and ensures that everyone will be able to attend the meeting at least once every five weeks.</p>

<h3>Assumptions of knowledge</h3>

<p>Being a teacher involves more than just purveying excellence in the art, craft and science of teaching. There’s a fair old bit of admin, too.</p>

<p>However intuitive and efficient the IT system is, a part-time teacher with full contact hours might have little opportunity to get comfortably acquainted with it. The same goes for college processes such as observations and exam entries.</p>

<p>Make time to ensure a part-time staffer knows how to navigate through the departmental protocol that isn’t necessarily touched upon in the organisation’s induction.</p>

<h3>Careful communication</h3>

<p>Accidentally omitting staff members from a group email that affects them is a common gaffe in colleges. It may seem like a trivial oversight, but it can have far-reaching consequences if that member of staff is already harbouring feelings of isolation. It’s a small thing, but it matters.</p>

<p>It’s worth remembering that a part-time staffer may have commitments to a number of organisations, so don’t assume you’ll receive a reply to emails on days that they aren’t contracted to your place. Wednesday and Thursday might be their weekend.</p>

<h3>Staffroom socialising</h3>

<p>Creating staffroom traditions are a fun way to involve everyone and keep communication flowing in a low-key manner. An occasional 50p sweepstake for <em>Strictly Come Dancing</em> or the Grand National can bond a group. As can organising a termly book club, or even making a motivational wall where staff write messages to keep spirits up. Anything too blinkeredly optimistic can also unite a group in mischievous rebellion.</p>

<p>Birthdays, get-togethers and other causes for celebration are a chance to unite or divide a staffroom. But they can easily turn into a scene from <em>Mean Girls</em> if people are forgotten. The rule for such occasions is to include everyone in the celebrations or don’t bother doing them at all.</p>

<p>It just takes a small amount of effort to boost camaraderie, but it can turn a team into a solid work family, regardless of the number of hours they clock.</p>

"351187","Fair apprenticeship reforms are crucial to their growth","/news/further-education/breaking-views/fair-apprenticeship-reforms-are-crucial-their-growth","Support for learners and small businesses, social mobility and proper skills funding should be among the new government’s priorities, says Mark Dawe","<p>Next week’s Association of Employment and Learning Providers’ (AELP) national conference is not just about the ups and downs of the apprenticeship reforms. We will also be debating the Sainsbury reforms for technical and professional education, devolution of employment and skills in England, and the current issues surrounding traineeships (see <a href=""http://bit.ly/AELPtrain"">bit.ly/AELPtrain</a>).</p>

<p>But as the new ministers get their feet under the table at the Department for Education, the future of apprenticeships will arguably be their biggest challenge outside of the issue of school funding.</p>

<p>It would be stretching it to say that ministers have inherited a poisoned chalice. After all, the levy components have opened up great new opportunities, especially at higher and degree-level apprenticeships, and driven large employer engagement in the programme.</p>

<p>In the context of Brexit and the government’s renewed commitments on migratory controls, it is vital that its flagship skills programme grows. We’ve said to the new team at the DfE that the emphasis on making training opportunities available wherever you live is why AELP is pressing for properly sustained and guaranteed support in the non-levy-paying business community – and this is not just a reference to apprenticeships.</p>

<p>Growing programmes like traineeships require responsive funding and proper measurement. English and maths, along with digital skills, must be properly funded, and the learner must be supported with whatever programme they are undertaking.</p>

<p>In the general election campaign, many training providers contacted their local parliamentary candidates with their concerns about the potential for “apprenticeship deserts” to appear in large areas of the country because of the very limited funding allocations for smaller businesses’ apprenticeships. Universities have now joined us in arguing that degree apprenticeships should not just be the preserve of large employers. Providers lobbied candidates on AELP’s call for guaranteed apprenticeship funding for non-levy-paying employers of at least £1 billion, no matter what levy is unused, and for non-levy-payers to be placed on the Apprenticeship Service as soon as possible to generate a genuine, employer-led system within the programme.</p>

<p>Ministers should also be ordering an immediate review of the impact of employer cash contributions on the small- and medium-sized enterprise apprenticeship starts. Anecdotal feedback from providers points to a significant fall in starts overall during the next few months because of the non-levy allocations, as well as levy-paying employers holding back from spending their entitlement.</p>

<p>What we don’t want is for the government to hit the panic button and make a major, sudden adjustment to the levers it can pull to stimulate or rein in demand. However, it should be increasing the non-levy allocations as soon as possible to maintain a sustainable and diverse provider base to serve employers across different sectors. A measured debate on the impact of the reforms would also be helped by greater transparency from the government, such as in publishing data on a monthly basis for levy and non-levy starts.</p>

<p>AELP was pleased that the Conservatives’ manifesto retained the 3 million apprenticeship starts target. We have always argued that this can be achieved without endangering the programme’s quality. The Institute for Apprenticeships should work with key stakeholders to ensure that all existing and new apprenticeship standards are fit for purpose, their assessments are reliable, and there is adequate funding to deliver a quality programme. Until these criteria are met, learners should not be started on new standards. Delivery should be inspected under one framework and end-point assessment should have one quality standardisation organisation.</p>

<h2>Something new to chew over</h2>

<p>The National Retraining Scheme proposed in the Conservatives’ manifesto will have given the civil servants something new to chew over when preparing the DfE ministers’ post-election briefings. Hopefully they will draw on the expertise and experience of our member providers as they draft a blueprint.</p>

<p>We hope the previous commitment to social mobility will remain part of the new government’s mantra. This requires support and development of level 2 programmes across all sectors as a first step for a young person or an adult needing to retrain. Maths and English provision within an apprenticeship should attract the same funding – £724 – as the provision receives on a standalone basis.</p>

<p>The DfE should commission a study of how much the provision now costs, although we can confidently say that, while £471 might cover the costs of delivering level 1 within an apprenticeship, it certainly doesn’t for level 2. Delivery should also count towards the apprentice’s off-the-job training, where appropriate.</p>

<p>The AELP conference will also see us call for tendering of the full £1.5 billion adult education budget, along with other training initiatives to ensure targeted and value-for-money delivery across regions and sectors. With AELP’s membership rapidly expanding to cover other types of providers, and our regional networks strengthening, the conference will demonstrate that we are ready to meet any challenges that the new government may throw at us.</p>

"351346","Is Harry Potter the boy who saved reading?","/news/school-news/breaking-views/harry-potter-boy-who-saved-reading","It's been 20 years since the first instalment of the bestselling series appeared on our bookshelves, but have the books had a magic effect on reading rates?","<p><em>Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</em> celebrates its 20th birthday today.</p>

<p>At Hogwarts, birthdays are usually celebrated with a slice of pumpkin pie, a game of wizard chess, and if you’re lucky, a trip to the Three Broomsticks for a Firewhisky or two.</p>

<p>But, at <em>Tes</em>, where the office is a mixture of Harry Potter fanatics, sceptics and (gulp) those who have never actually delved into JK Rowling’s world of witchcraft and wizardry, we’re commemorating the anniversary by asking: is Harry Potter the Boy Who Saved Literacy?</p>

<p>The statistics are, undoubtedly, impressive: seven books, translated into 68 languages, with 400 million copies sold (and still selling) worldwide.</p>

<p>But did the power of Potter really get pupils (and their parents) reading? In the latest issue of <em>Tes</em>, Sarah Cunnane sets out to answer this question.</p>

<p>She gathered an expert panel of muggles – both proud Potterheads and firm disbelievers – to give their opinion on the JK Rowling effect. Here's what they had to say:</p>

<h2><strong>The world-renowned reading specialist </strong></h2>

<p>Daniel Willingham, one of the world’s leading cognitive scientists, an expert in reading and a professor of psychology at the University of Virginia, proudly explains that he found the books relatable and enjoyable.</p>

<p>But he dismisses any notion of Harry Potter having a widespread effect on children’s literacy.</p>

<p>“I think the ‘Harry Potter effect’ was the secret hope of parents and teachers trying to find the perfect book for a child. A lot of eager, enthusiastic adult readers had a book like that: they had a book that they fell in love with that told them reading was worth their time,” he says.</p>

<p>“It’s possible that all those people who are enthusiastic adult readers had that magic book, but not all children who have a magic book become eager adult readers.”</p>

<h2><strong>The Hazza hater </strong></h2>

<p>English teacher Katherine Howard was more than happy to send us a Howler on the subject. She doesn’t own a single Harry Potter novel.</p>

<p>“The vocabulary doesn’t stretch as other literary works manage to do; Harry’s story of success is neither believable or achievable to the average (or less than average) child,” she writes.</p>

<p>“If I work hard enough, I cannot and will not excel at either wizardry or Quidditch – and the obstacles encountered by Harry on his journey during the Hotel Hoggles years does not resonate with me as a child nor adult.”</p>

<p>(Potterheads,<strong> </strong>before you get overly despondent, remember Albus Dumbledore’s wise words: “Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.”)</p>

<h2><strong>The linguist</strong></h2>

<p>Jane Sunderland, an honorary reader in linguists and English language at Lancaster University, interviewed hundreds of primary- and secondary-aged children as part of a qualitative survey in 2012-13 to find out about the effect of the books and what children themselves thought.</p>

<p>The survey showed that, actually, about half of the children hadn’t read the books.</p>

<p>In terms of the books’ impact on literacy, Sunderland says it’s difficult to make a distinct pronouncement.</p>

<p>However, the children were asked if they thought that the series had made a difference to their reading and the majority of them said that Harry Potter had helped them to read more fiction, more books and harder books.</p>

<h2><strong>The Potterhead teacher</strong></h2>

<p>Key stage 3 coordinator, James Tickle – a self-proclaimed Ravenclaw – has been using <em>Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</em> to teach a scheme of work in Year 7 for the past four years or so (bit.ly/HPlessons).</p>

<p>He says: “It’s a genuine pleasure to explore with pupils – the book is complex enough that you can do so much with it. There’s so many different directions you can go. You can get really creative.’</p>

<p>Tickle credits the series for keeping up his love of reading when it was in danger of falling away.</p>

<p>“Boys tend to drop off reading in the teenage years and then pick it up again a few years later. It did encourage me to go out and find other books, so I didn’t have that break in reading. It helped me longer term,” he says.</p>

<h2><strong>Harry Potter and the pupil who loves him</strong></h2>

<p>Kathryn is an eight-year-old who’d happily be in Gryffindor (“because they’re brave”) or Ravenclaw (“because they’re clever”).</p>

<p>“The Harry Potter series is amazing. It is one of the best things I’ve ever read. I like it because it’s about people fighting for what they believe in and not giving up,” she says.</p>

<p>So, is Harry the greatest literary hero of the last 20 years? In Kathryn's view, undoubtedly, yes.</p>

<p>Did he actually save literacy? Perhaps not.</p>

<p>But the effect the books have had on countless individual young (and older) lives? Well, that’s clearly magic.</p>

<p>Amanda Spielman also pledged to expand <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/ofsted-0"">Ofsted</a>’s research remit, ensuring that its conclusions are based not “on personal prejudices or hobby horses, but on proper evidence from the ground”.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/amanda-spielmans-speech-at-the-festival-of-education"">Speaking today</a> at the annual Festival of Education, held at Wellington College in Berkshire, Ms Spielman said: “One area where there is room to improve is the active promotion of fundamental British values in our schools. Recent attacks in Westminster, London Bridge, Manchester and Finsbury Park have brought into start relief the threats we face.</p>

<p>“When it comes to tackling extremism through inspection, I have exactly the same zeal and passion as my predecessor.”</p>

<p>Ms Spielman’s predecessor as chief inspector, Sir Michael Wilshaw, came under criticism from MPs in the wake of the 2013 Trojan Horse scandal, during which it was alleged that extremist Muslim groups wanted to take over some schools in Birmingham and run them according to strict Islamic principles.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/trojan-horse-mps-criticise-ofsted-and-department-education"">In a report into the scandal</a>, the Commons Education Select Committee said the affair had revealed less about extremism than about “the ability of local and central agencies to respond to whistle-blowers and to correct abuses of power within schools.”</p>

<p>The MPs’ report was particularly critical of the way in which Ofsted and the Department for Education responded to the controversy.</p>

<p>It said that confidence in Ofsted had been “undermined” and that the inspectorate’s “inability to identify problems at some Birmingham schools on first inspection, when they were found shortly afterwards to be failing, raises questions about the appropriateness of the framework and the reliability and robustness of Ofsted’s judgements and how they are reached”.</p>

<h2>'What really matters in education'</h2>

<p>In her speech today, Ms Spielman also said that she would extend Ofsted’s <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/research-and-pedagogy"">research</a> function.</p>

<p>“We’re going to be looking at the validity and reliability of our inspections, making sure we look at what really matters in education, and that our judgements are consistent and reliable,” she said.</p>

<p>“And, more generally, we are thinking about how evidence is used across the whole of Ofsted.”</p>

<p>And she said that boosting the watchdog’s research work would allow it to play a much greater role in informing government policy.</p>

<p>“I also want us to have a much greater engagement with the wider research community,” she said. “My hope is that, by sharing and analysing more of what we find, we can play a larger role in informing education policy. Not a role that is based on personal prejudices or hobby horses, but on proper evidence from the ground.”</p>

<p>Ms Spielman also used the speech to reiterate her commitment to focusing on the substance of the curriculum, <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/ofsted-warns-schools-they-face-greater-scrutiny-over-substance-what"">as reported in <em>Tes </em>last week</a>. She repeated her desire to make sure that there is more to education than simply preparing for exams.</p>

<p>But she added: “It is here that I believe we can do more. Our <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/inspection"">inspection</a> framework doesn’t yet fully capture the substance of education.”</p>

<p>I’ve worked in loads of places now, most of which I would merrily march my own lad towards, some I would tackle him to the ground to prevent him from going within 100 yards of.</p>

<p>The crucial factor isn’t quality of teaching, availability of resources or jazziness of the new-build. My priority is safety. Would my lad be safe in that environment? Does the organisation (to be fair, it’s more about the culture of particular sites than the whole college) protect students with the same measures that would be expected in the rest of society?</p>

<p>A place I worked for early on seemed to have looked to the Wild West for its behaviour policy; serious incidents were commonplace. A boy was battered with a cue ball in a sock, Scum-style, by a group of students, all caught on CCTV, but none were excluded and police weren’t called.</p>

<p>A badly beaten student was sent to hospital in a taxi with what turned out to be a fractured skull; again, no police, no ambulance. One enterprising soul was intercepted recruiting and running a prostitution ring from the library. And I was repeatedly threatened with rape by a student – an ordeal that, when reported to the site’s dodgy sheriff, I was told was due to my failings in behaviour management.</p>

<p>That no-consequences state-funded fight club was all about bums on seats and funding in the bank. I later learned that what went on at that site was shrouded from senior management throughout the rest of what was actually a pretty good college. Although I’ve never experienced such a grotesquely warped sense of managerial priority in the years since, the culture of wedge over welfare still exists.</p>

<p>A mate of mine teaches in a college where the relationship between two of his students, both vying for alpha status through bullying and numerous behavioural incidents, recently came to a violent denouement in a corridor. The incident required a number of staff to break it up; students who intervened were injured; and many of the kids who witnessed it were left traumatised.</p>

<p>Were this to happen outside of perceived college jurisdiction, police would be involved. My friend told me that the incident resulted in student disciplinary meetings, a period of suspension, then back to business as usual for the students involved. His college is well thought of and usually has a robust behavioural response, but after this, he isn’t just disappointed by the management, he’s disgusted.</p>

<p>A lack of appropriate sanction should not be prettied up as “inclusion”. We know that it’s about putting the funding of the few above the safety of the many, a rationale that doesn’t just reflect badly on the college involved, but on FE as a whole.</p>

<p>So if you are one of the people who have to mitigate such disciplinary issues, ask yourself this question: would you want your own child at that site?</p>

"352228","'When cats, kebabs and food tech lessons collide...'","/news/school-news/breaking-views/when-cats-kebabs-and-food-tech-lessons-collide","In the latest in a fortnightly series, one 'travelling teacher' remembers one memorable lesson in which he really managed to use technology to its full potential. Or did he? ","<p>The fog clears, and here we are. And it’s all gone a bit technology-colliding-with-drama-colliding-with-suspension of disbelief.</p>

<p>It’s Year 9 food technology in a special school for children who struggle in mainstream.</p>

<p>The setting is ace and is a real trailblazer in terms of their approach to the curriculum. I’ve been asked to help with a curriculum reboot and am working alongside classroom teachers with their planning and subsequent delivery to the pupils. I’m a familiar face around the school and feel very much at home.</p>

<p>Technology colleagues and I have been looking at how we can get the pupils to <em>present </em>their learning around healthy eating, moving away from the usual PowerPoint approach.  We’ve talked about how we might <em>hook </em>the kids in and get them to <em>want </em>to present.</p>

<p>It’s the hook that’s the key.</p>

<p>I turn up to the meeting with what I believe will be a great hook: a blog written by a fictional cat-loving kebab shop owner called Mick. I’ve spent my Sunday evening creating the five Wordpress blogposts that basically roll out the sorry tale of Mick and his trouble with the council. They are threatening to shut down his takeaway if he doesn’t offer a healthier menu. It’s clear from the blog that Mick doesn’t know a lot about healthy eating and could really do with some help. And he really shouldn’t go on about his love for his cats and their love for his donner meat.</p>

<p>At the end of the last blog I include a selfie of, er, myself, to ensure the pupils are in on the fictional aspect of the blog. In a way, the kids have been offered a design brief and this is what their teacher presents to them. When the kids see the last blogpost and my selfie they nod and say things like:</p>

<p>""That’s that bloke.""</p>

<p>""That’s Mr Roberts. We saw him in Year Eight. He was an airline pilot back then.""</p>

<p>""He’s not actually a real person that Mick.""</p>

<p>…so it’s happily clear that they know this is a fiction – a way of getting the end of project assessment done and dusted, and a nice alternative to a worksheet or PowerPoint presentation.</p>

<p>‘Shall we invite him in? Perhaps we can help him?’ the teacher asks them and they very quickly send me a message via Wordpress, inviting ""Mick"" to the school to learn some stuff about healthy eating.</p>

<p>I reply immediately and the date is set.</p>

<p>The function of the presentations will be to enlighten Mick, and for him to become a better, more health-conscious proprietor of Mick’s Kebabs.</p>

<p>On the morning of the presentations, I go a bit ‘method’, don’t shave or shower. I don’t iron my shirt and get some left-over gravy from our fridge and smear it down my front. Who knew that education could be this much fun?</p>

<p>Driving to the school I start to worry that they may have had the Ofsted call.</p>

<p>They haven’t, and pretty soon I’m sitting in front of Year 9 being asked prepared questions about my take away shop, my menu, the wholesale price I pay for my hotdogs and burgers and why I think it’s so cheap, and my cats and why I let them wander around the shop. My answers paint an amusing picture of someone who definitely does need help.</p>

<p>We then move to a carousel presentation activity where I go from table to table essentially being educated by these very knowledgeable pupils. On the last table, I meet Thomas, Kyle and Beth who show me all sorts of stuff that they’ve learned. As with the other tables, I nod, ask questions and model all the things a positive learner should be.</p>

<p>Thomas puts his hand on my arm and leans in.</p>

<p>""Listen, mate, you’ve really got to sort yourself out,"" he whispers, ""You’re wasting your life.""</p>

<p>I nod, not really knowing what to say, and uncertain if he’s talking to me, Mr Roberts, the visiting teacher, or Mick, a fictional kebab shop owner from inside my head. Before we know it, the session is done. I say my farewells and leave. The presentations have been an enormous success.</p>

<p>The class teacher later contacted me saying that the hook of the blog and the teacher-in-role had been useful and had encouraged genuine pupil investment.</p>

<p>And then there was Thomas’s feedback to her: apparently as soon as I’d left, he’d turned to his teacher and classmates and said</p>

<p><em>""I’m sorry to say it, but that Mick is completely thick. What a moron.""</em></p>

<p>And the fog descends.</p>

<p>In the words of Boris Karloff, <em>the children have never fallen for my nonsense.</em></p>

"352792","Outside influences can be just what children need","/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/outside-influences-can-be-just-what-children-need","Research has shown the positive impact that residential experiences can have on students. For some, it can be life-changing","<p>Teenager Ben* was reluctant to go on a three-night residential with his school in East Kilbride. He was on the cusp of disengagement from his lessons and the cost of attending was too much of a financial burden on his family. After much encouragement from his teachers, the school cajoled Ben into going and supported him with the costs.</p>

<p>The trip was a sports development residential, offering Ben a chance to take part in sports he loved but had not previously been able to study in depth. He flourished and became re-engaged with his studies. When he got back to school, he took part in after-school activities, and accepted a leadership role, returning on the residential the following year as a sports leader.</p>

<p>Tony McDaid, former headteacher at Ben’s school, says: “There is no doubt that residential activity played a pivotal role [in re-engaging Ben], and it came at just the right time for him.” Ben has now left school and is studying sports coaching at university.</p>

<p>Ben’s story is just one example from the compelling findings of the Learning Away action research programme (<a href=""http://learningaway.org.uk"">learningaway.org.uk</a>), which spanned five years with 60 primary, secondary and special schools, developing and testing a wide range of inclusive and affordable residentials ranging from camping in the school grounds to staying in a palace.</p>

<h2>Building resilience and relationships</h2>

<p>The research produced overwhelming evidence about the numerous positive impacts a residential experience can have on pupils, improving their resilience, attainment, relationships and engagement with learning.</p>

<p>Another school, in Kent, used its residentials to enhance attainment in core subjects for those students identified as borderline C/D. This made a life-changing difference to Melissa*, who had very low confidence and persistently refused to go to school.</p>

<p>Following an outdoor residential in which core subjects such as maths were integrated into fun activities, Melissa left school with grade C and above in English, maths and science, going on to study construction at college.</p>

<p>Her teachers are convinced that without this residential, Melissa’s refusal to attend school would almost certainly have led to her being neither in employment nor education.</p>

<p>While Learning Away believes all residentials have their benefits, they want to encourage schools to run what we call “brilliant residentials”, getting the very most out of these learning experiences.</p>

<p>We are campaigning to ensure that children of all ages and backgrounds are provided with just such an experience while at school. And I’m delighted to say that East Ayrshire Council is leading the way: it is the first authority in Scotland to announce that all pupils, across its 54 schools, will be entitled to a high-quality residential learning experience.</p>

<p>Ms Greening, speaking at the <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-news/corbyn-life-long-training-crucial-economy"">British Chambers of Commerce’s Business and Education Summit</a> in London today, said a National Leaders of Further Education programme would help to ""lift up"" areas of the FE sector that are ""further behind"" than others.</p>

<p>Ms Greening said: “There is a wide array of talent in the FE sector, so I want more of that to be able to contribute to lifting the whole FE system. So I am going to establish a programme of National Leaders of Further Education, people who will recognise and identify as these best principals, the senior leaders across the FE sector, and I want to make sure these people are empowered to spread their expert knowledge, their experience, as well as to mentor and support and to lift up the parts of our FE system that are further behind.”</p>

<p>A National Leaders of Education programme already exists to support headteachers to work alongside and support struggling schools, but this does not extend to FE providers.</p>

<h2><strong>‘FE needs to be far more attractive’</strong></h2>

<p>Ms Greening also pledged to do more to improve teaching quality in technical education – something she said was a “critical step” – and said the FE sector would need to be “far more attractive” if it were to succeed in <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-views/could-fe-solve-teacher-shortage"">recruiting teachers </a>into the workforce.</p>

<p>She said: “The teachers and the teaching professionals in FE are going to be at the forefront of how we make sure all of the changes on <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-views/wholl-teach-t-levels"">things like T levels</a> are really delivered on a day to day basis.""</p>

<p>Ms Greening added: ""I think we need to get business more plugged in. I think it needs to be a more streamlined relationship between business and FE; I think that we need to make FE far more attractive; [and] I think teachers coming into that profession really need to be feel like they’re part of something that’s absolutely going to either make our country successful or not and that they’re at the centre of making that happen.”</p>

<h2>'Existing government skills policy'</h2>

<p>Ian Pretty, chief executive of the Collab Group of colleges, said aside from the announcement of a Strategic College Improvement Fund and an expansion of the FE commissioner’s role, the speech had ""largely re-affirmed existing government skills policy"". ""The general thrust of this policy is to be welcomed but in policy such as the £500 million funding to reform technical education there is still very little detail about exactly how these funds will be distributed.""</p>

<p>He added: ""The speech also reaffirmed the Conservative manifesto commitment to develop a dedicated programme to help industry experts join the FE sector. This might be helpful.  But what we now need to see is a shift from a conceptual discussion to practical and pragmatic implementation.  If we are all to truly deliver the cultural shift that Justine Greening referenced in her speech, we will need to be creative in our thinking. Simply recruiting business people into the sector is not new.""</p>

<p>Asking primary school children to explain their answers and reason with their classmates can help them to make more progress in these core subjects, <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/research-and-pedagogy"">research</a> published by the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) suggests.</p>

<p>A total of 78 <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/primary"">primary schools</a> in England with higher than average proportions of <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/disadvantage"">disadvantaged pupils</a> took part in the trial of ""dialogic teaching"", devised and piloted by <a href=""http://www.robinalexander.org.uk"">Professor Robin Alexander</a>, chairman of the Cambridge Primary Review Trust.</p>

<p>Around 2,500 nine- and 10-year-olds were given lessons in which they were encouraged to explain their answers and reasoning, and to debate, discuss and argue with others about them.</p>

<p>This was done by instructing the teachers to ask open questions and to encourage pupils to do more than simply state their answer.</p>

<h2>Thinking and learning</h2>

<p>An independent evaluation of the initiative by academics at Sheffield Hallam University found that those pupils who took part in the study made an average of two months’ more progress in <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/english"">English</a> and <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/science"">science</a> than a similar group of pupils who did not take part, and therefore formed a control group.</p>

<p>In addition, poorer children who took part in the programme made two months’ more progress in <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/mathematics"">maths</a>. In general, children who took part made around a month's more progress in the subject than the control group.</p>

<p>Children in both groups were tested in each of the subjects before and after the programme.</p>

<p>The findings indicate that this type of teaching may improve pupils’ overall thinking and learning skills, rather than just their subject knowledge, the EEF said.</p>

<p>Teachers were in favour of the scheme, but many felt that they needed more than two terms in order to make it fully part of their classroom teaching.</p>

<h2>'Damning indictment'</h2>

<p>Sir Kevan Collins, chief executive of the EEF, said: ""Getting children to think and talk about their own learning more explicitly can be one of the most effective ways to improve academic outcomes. But it can be difficult to put this into practice in the classroom.</p>

<p>“While there is no simple strategy or trick, today's evaluation report on dialogic teaching does give primary school <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/headteachers"">heads</a> and teachers practical evidence on an approach that appears to be effective across different subjects.""</p>

<p>Mary Bousted, general secretary of the ATL teaching union, said: “Teachers know that giving children space to talk thoughtfully and openly, rather than feeling forced to give correct answers, leads to sustained learning, and it is encouraging that this report supports this.</p>

<p>“That this kind of practice doesn't happen routinely is a damning indictment of the testing regime and accountability system, which ensures teaching to the test is far more common. It's also clear that dialogic teaching is about much more than just letting children talk, and that teachers need time to learn how best to implement this kind of teaching. </p>

<p>“Until the government addresses the toxic accountability system that leads to children and schools feeling like failures if they don't get the right answers, children, particularly at the top end of primary, will continue to be focused on passing tests, rather than sustained, thoughtful, critical learning.”</p>

"353170","'The day I urged a bike thief to change his life and consider college'","/news/further-education/breaking-views/day-i-urged-a-bike-thief-change-his-life-and-consider-college","When she got the chance to confront the boy who stole her son's bike, former NUS Scotland president Vonnie Sandlan found herself delivering a life lesson","<p>I thought I had the weekend planned out well. Some quiet time at home after my first week at my new job, and finishing an essay for university. That all went out the window on Saturday evening when my 16-year-old son phoned me, deeply distressed that the lock on his brand new bike had been cut and his bike stolen, in the 10 minutes that it took him to get an ice cream with his friends.</p>

<p>Having dispatched my husband to go into Glasgow city centre and bring him home, I turned to social media, initially to vent my frustration and then, thinking more strategically, to share details of the bike on as many selling groups and sites as I could access. Knowing that the brand of the bike wasn’t very common, I wanted to ensure that I’d done everything I could to track it down but in all honesty I wasn’t expecting that we would ever see it again. I sent one son, absolutely devastated, off to bed.</p>

<p>I’ve talked in the past about my own challenges in the labour market prior to returning to education, but suffice to say we’re not a family that has been able to have big special purchases very often. Findlay had saved up for quite some time to buy this bike, topped up with money from his recent birthday. I was sure that we were not going to be in a financial position to replace it, and the excess on our insurance made claiming almost pointless.</p>

<h2>'I need to talk to you'</h2>

<p>On Sunday I woke to a message from someone who had noticed that the bike had now been advertised on a selling platform. That very kind stranger continued messaging the seller in order to arrange to meet and view the bike, and at 7.30pm – 22 hours after the bike had been stolen – I had the bike in my hands.</p>

<p>What followed has been widely covered over the past day or so; indeed, <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-40553876"">you may have seen or heard coverage yourself</a>. Secure in the knowledge that I had the bike, and confident that the young boy who met my husband and I was alone, I felt a sudden burst of frustration. This boy seemed to be around the same age as my son, and here he was making terrible life decisions which were unlikely to lead anywhere positive. “Come over here a minute,” I said to the now sobbing teen. “I need to talk to you about what you’re doing.”</p>

<p>In my previous guise as an NUS Scotland officer, I spent three years pushing an agenda of better access and participation in post-16 pathways for young people who have consistently been displaced from these opportunities. I fundamentally believe that meritocracy is a myth and that there are a myriad of barriers which stand between young people and positive destinations but that colleges and quality apprenticeships are instrumental in tackling that inequality. I believe that education is a public and social good, and that colleges punch above their weight in redistributing social capital by consistently bringing those most distanced from the labour market into education opportunities which otherwise would not exist.</p>

<h2>'College was life-changing for me'</h2>

<p>And so in that moment I was standing in an area ranked by the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation as decile 1– one of the most deprived 10 per cent of areas by pretty much every measure going. I looked at this young boy on the precipice of adulthood, and I asked him to consider what he was doing. To think about his future, and about where the decisions he was making were likely to take him. I shared with him that school had been difficult for me, but that college had been a life-changing experience for me and had given me the tools and skills to get involved in work that really made me feel happy and fulfilled. I told him that school might not be working for him but that college or an apprenticeship might be right for him, and I urged him to reflect upon where this path would take him.</p>

<p>My former colleague Shakira Martin, who is <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-news/fes-shakira-martin-elected-nus-president"">now the president of the National Union of Students</a>, has spoken candidly about her past, and it was Shakira who made me think about skills in an entirely different capacity. She reflected recently that the skills required working as a courier for a  drug dealer - data protection, client confidentiality, customer service – were transferable business skills. And to be flippant, this kid had also demonstrated transferable skills in the process of obtaining and attempting to sell on this bike!</p>

<p>The really interesting thing about this whole saga, for me, is that it has started a conversation about the way in which I approached it, and I have to say that I have been pleasantly surprised with the compassion and consideration shown on social media where our story has been discussed. The simple facts remain that there is no better antidote to social inequality than skills and education, and I sincerely hope that this young boy makes new plans for his education journey.</p>

"353884","Exclusive: Justine Greening confirms 90 per cent EBacc target to be pushed back ","/news/school-news/breaking-news/exclusive-justine-greening-confirms-90-cent-ebacc-target-be-pushed","The government's plans for the EBacc have finally been confirmed eighteen months after the consultation closed ","<p>The government has officially abandoned plans to require nine in 10 pupils to sit GCSEs in the core academic subjects that make up the English Baccalaureate (EBacc) by 2020, the education secretary has confirmed. </p>

<p>Justine Greening has said that the government will only expect 75 per cent of pupils to be studying EBacc subjects – English, mathematics, history or geography, the sciences and a language – by 2022.</p>

<p>Under plans set out in the <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/ebacc-schools-could-have-wait-until-summer-see-governments"">EBacc consultation that closed 18 months ago</a>, 90 per cent of pupils would sit GCSEs in EBacc subjects in 2020.</p>

<p>The<a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/schools-get-five-extra-years-hit-ebacc-target-under-tory-plans""> <strong>Conservative manifesto</strong></a> watered down this target, stating that 90 per cent of pupils would be ""studying this combination of academic GCSEs by 2025"".</p>

<p>The change came after <em>Tes </em>revealed exclusively in March that the government was looking to change the original target partly because of a <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/exclusive-dfe-could-water-down-90-cent-ebacc-target"">dearth of specialist subject teachers.</a></p>

<p>The consultation response published by the government today clarifies this further. It says: ""<font color=""#0d0d0d"">It is our ambition that 75 per cent of year 10 pupils in state-funded mainstream schools should be starting </font>to study EBacc GCSE courses nationally by 2022 (taking their exams in 2024), rising to 90 per cent by 2025 (taking their exams in 2027).""</p>

<p>In the forward to the consultation response, Ms Greening said: ""I know it will take time for our nation’s schools to enter 90 per cent of pupils for the EBacc subjects and I do not underestimate the challenge involved in meeting this ambition from our current position.</p>

<p>""While some schools are already responding to this challenge by significantly increasing their EBacc entry, I appreciate that some will be starting from a much lower point and recognise that the changes they will need to make and challenges they need to overcome will be more significant.""</p>

<p>She added: ""I also recognise the time needed to meet these challenges and build the right capacity across the whole school system, particularly to ensure that schools have high-quality staff in the right subjects.</p>

<p>""I have considered the way in which some schools have increased entries in the past five years, how best to support schools over the coming years and that pupils taking GCSEs in 2019 will already have chosen the subjects they will study.</p>

<p>""It is therefore my ambition, as set out in the 2017 Conservative manifesto, that 75 per cent of Year 10 pupils in state-funded mainstream schools will start to study GCSEs in the EBacc combination of subjects by September 2022 as an important stepping stone to reaching 90 per cent of Year 10 pupils studying GCSEs in the EBacc subjects by 2025.""</p>

<p>The move follows <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/exclusive-vast-majority-heads-oppose-90-cent-ebacc-plan"">concerns from headteachers about the target</a>, partly due to a shortage of language teachers.</p>

<p>In 2015, ministers already <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/tories-water-down-pledge-make-ebac-compulsory-all"">watered down the Conservatives' original pledge</a> to make the EBacc compulsory for all.</p>

Tes asked pupils across the UK to rank the characteristics they valued most in those tasked with teaching them. The answers threw up some unexpected results, as Georgia Ziebart reports","
      <p>Funny: that’s what students want you, their teacher, to be. And they don’t just want you to have a joke in your teaching toolbox to provide some light relief from the drudgery of endless exams. Asked by Tes to list the characteristics that every teacher should possess, more than 3,000 students – from primary, secondary and special schools – said the ability to amuse was not just an important attribute, but something that determined whether a teacher was truly great.</p>
      <p>“Funny teachers are more personable and connect with you more,” argues one secondary student in the Midlands. “Because of this, you feel more respected and you feel comfortable going to that teacher with your problems because there’s less pressure”</p>
      <p>A primary student in the South West of England believes that humour goes to the heart of effective schooling. “Teachers should be funny because you don’t want kids to think school is too serious and boring,” they say. “It makes the lesson interesting and you want to learn more.”</p>
      <p>If you’re reading this in disbelief, then you will not be alone. But the survey was no close-run race: Tes crunched the survey data into a primary list (see box, opposite) and a secondary list (see box, page 36) of the 25 most popular answers, and “funny” won by a landslide on both counts.</p>
      <p>The other characteristics on the lists are a little more conventional. The survey suggests that both the perfect primary teacher and the superior secondary teacher require a mix of the personal touch (“accepting”, “kind” and “a good listener” all made the cut), and essential teaching skills (“organised”, “knowledgeable” and “fair” also featured). And there was near agreement across the age phases: 18 of the characteristics appear on both lists.</p>
      <p>Now, it could be argued that such lists are interesting, but that a teacher should be judged on how well they teach, regardless of how they may act; whether the children learn or not should trump how much a student likes a teacher or how many of the list of 25 traits a teacher can tick off.</p>
      <p>Yet the counter argument is that the two are intimately connected. Research is pretty conclusive on the fact that student-teacher relationships are integral to learning, and here is a list that tells you what students believe are the component parts of that relationship.</p>
      <p>At a time when pupil wellbeing is under the microscope, and with the desire to maximise the progress of students top of every teacher’s agenda, is it not worth looking more closely at what drives these choices – and perhaps even taking them seriously?</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Mixing humour and seriousness</p>
      <p>While you might expect the teaching profession to recoil in horror on hearing that students want their classrooms staffed by Peter Kay and Miranda Hart, many teachers were not surprised that a sense of humour featured so highly. For those teachers, being funny is the “human” part of the role.</p>
      <p>Clare Erasmus, director of mental health and wellbeing at The Magna Carta School in Surrey, believes wit and humour “help to build the bond between student and teacher”.</p>
      <p>Others say that humour is important for diffusing difficult situations and setting an example for how students should behave. David Gower, assistant head of King Edward VI School in Bury St Edmunds, says “being able to mix a lighthearted tone with moments of seriousness helps students to understand how to behave in different situations”.</p>
      <p>Another popular view is that humour doesn’t only benefit the student, but the teacher, too. Alice Edgington, deputy head at St Stephen’s Infant School in Canterbury, believes that all teachers should “go home and laugh about your teaching day, whether it’s been a good day or a bad day”. Perhaps students have picked up on workload stress and identified the funny teachers as those who are coping best?</p>
      <p>But some educators aren’t buying it. “I’ve worked with excellent teachers who are not in the slightest bit funny, as well as with hilarious performers who couldn’t get their pupils to learn anything,” says John Rutter, headteacher at Inverness High School.</p>
      <p>“The ability to have a laugh is important in creating a classroom atmosphere that’s conducive to learning, but may be more important in the minds of pupils than it is in promoting real educational gains.”</p>
      <p>Julian Dutnall, headteacher at Frances Bardsley Academy, thinks “there are some dangers if teachers try to be funny to win popularity and then struggle to maintain discipline or objectivity”.</p>
      <p>When you work your way down the list, you also begin to see how “funny” might contradict other sought-after characteristics. For example, sarcasm may be a way of showing humour, but it can also be considered disrespectful; “respectful” came 16th on the primary list and 11th for secondary. “There is a fine line between sarcasm that is mutually considered amusing and quick-witted, and sarcasm that is belittling and publicly humiliating,” concurs Erasmus.</p>
      <p>Funny is not the only aspect of the list that causes confusion. Most of the teachers involved in the survey thought the list their students had come up with was fair, but there were concerns about prioritisation and noticeable missing elements.</p>
      <p>For example, “respectful” ranked relatively low, but many teachers assert that being respectful can be the key to engagement and great teaching. “As a secondary school teacher, I think that respect for secondary students is a significant part of their development into being young adults,” says Sean Sycamore, deputy head of Comberton Village College in Cambridgeshire.</p>
      <p>Also noteworthy was the fact that certain qualities appeared on one list, but not the other. “I’m surprised that ‘strict at the right time’ only appears on the primary list of words,” says Gower. “I think it’s important for secondary school teachers, too. Strict often has negative connotations, but I think students like a teacher to establish clear expectations of behaviour and to be consistent in the way that they deal with these.”</p>
      <p>Indeed, direct reference to behaviour management does not appear at all on the secondary list, but there are characteristics such as “patient” and “gives chances”, which suggest a less-than-total-obedience model is what older students desire.</p>
      <p>As for what else is missing, Erasmus lists some qualities she feels definitely deserve a place: “I might add: consistent; flexible; a growth mindset; authentic. I also think teachers need to be able to acknowledge their mistakes.</p>
      <p>Of course, what the teachers think of the list is a different question to what they think should be done with it. It is easy to pat students on the back and say “very interesting”, but should we take their thoughts on what makes a great teacher seriously?</p>
      <p>“Our students are our best judges and they know what great teaching is,” argues David Barrs, headteacher at Anglo European School. “Being challenged to put it into words has given them the language they need to help them recognise it when they see it.”</p>
      <p>That, presumably, is a yes.</p>
      <p>Research also suggests that we should listen to our pupils: studies have found that students have unique perspectives on their own learning and these insights can create positive change if adults respond appropriately.</p>
      <p>“Dialogue between teachers and students is essential to the most engaging and effective teaching and learning,” says Alison Cook-Sather, professor of education at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, US.</p>
      <p>Dana Mitra, professor of education theory and policy at Penn State College of Education, adds that “student-voice initiatives improve classroom practice”.</p>
      <p>“Students can improve academically when teachers construct their classrooms in ways that value student voice – especially when students are given the power to work with their teachers to improve curriculum and instruction,” she adds.</p>
      <p>However, others are wary. “We should listen to children and they should have a voice, but ‘pupil voice’ needs to be approached with caution,” says Peter Worley, chief executive of the Philosophy Foundation. “Pupil voice should not be treated uncritically. We need to encourage children to voice their opinions while ensuring that what they say is still open to critical scrutiny from their peers.”</p>
      <p>And Kevin Courtney, general secretary of the NUT teaching union, says that using the list as some form of “checklist” would not be welcomed. “[The survey] highlights the importance of the pastoral role of teachers, and that teaching is about far more than simply imparting knowledge to children and young people,” he says. “However, converting this into a tick-list for training or inspection would not be welcome. Indeed, the idea of Ofsted inspectors judging whether a teacher is ‘funny’ simply doesn’t bear thinking about.”</p>
      <p>Yet, interestingly, there is evidence that some of the characteristics are already a factor in teacher selection.</p>
      <p>“We aim to attract the best and brightest into classrooms, and we look for a range of qualities based on international evidence of what makes the most effective teachers,” says Teach First executive director Sam Freedman. “But actually there is some crossover with what these young people identify and our focus on communication, problem-solving, knowledge and planning.”</p>
      <p>Sue O’Brien, head of academic development at the Sheffield Institute of Education, adds that “ITT courses are designed with the Teachers’ Standards (2013) at the heart of them and…they do emphasise that trainees must ‘demonstrate consistently the positive attitudes, values and behaviour which are expected of pupils’.”</p>
      <p>Many of these positive attitudes were recognised by the students in their choices: being fair, understanding and supportive.</p>
      <p>“Of course, it is difficult to select for these, but, through references and interview tasks, we do look for these characteristics,” she says.</p>
      <p>But O’Brien adds that trainers look for other things when recruiting, too: resilience, for example, which does not feature on the list. Students may not immediately recognise characteristics such as these in the classroom, but they’ll certainly notice if they’re missing.</p>
      <p>If a candidate came through the door lacking resilience, there are emerging theories of how it might be taught to them. But let’s say we took our lists seriously – could we ensure teachers possess all of these qualities? Could you teach someone to be funny?</p>
      <p>Some argue that you can. “Professional comedians typically become funnier with experience and improv comedy schools teach people to become better improvisers,” says Peter McGraw, marketing and psychology professor at the University of Colorado Boulder, US, and director of the Humor Research Lab. “Research reveals that people can improve other skills, such as mindfulness, communication ability and compassion.</p>
      <p>Similarly, Bill Lucas, director of the Centre for Real-World Learning at the University of Winchester, believes that most of the other attributes students have chosen can be taught.</p>
      <p>“All of the attributes are learnable to some extent, but given that trainee teachers are adults, those that are more about personality are inevitably harder to change,” he says.</p>
      <p>Such efforts to train teachers would require strong evidence that these characteristics do make a difference – ITT programmes are notoriously crammed already. But while there is plenty of research to say student-teacher relationships are important, proof of what goes into productive teacher-student relationships is scarce.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think there’s much research on [forming student-teacher relationships],” says Dylan Wiliam, emeritus professor of educational assessment at the UCL Institute of Education. “It’s really more about being a decent human being.”</p>
      <p>Without such evidence, you could argue the lists should remain of interest, but not of instructional value.</p>
      <p>Yet taken together, what the lists really describe is exactly what Wiliam instructs his students to be: a decent human being. In a system so intent on taking emotion out of schooling and replacing it with cold, hard data, it’s too easy to lose sight of the humanity that makes being a teacher great – and that also makes great teachers.</p>
      <p>What these lists represent is a reminder (and permission) to embrace that side of yourself once again. And for that, it is worth taking them very seriously indeed.</p>

      <p>Funny: that’s what students want you, their teacher, to be. And they don’t just want you to have a joke in your teaching toolbox to provide some light relief from the drudgery of endless exams. Asked by Tes to list the characteristics that every teacher should possess, more than 3,000 students – from primary, secondary and special schools – said the ability to amuse was not just an important attribute, but something that determined whether a teacher was truly great.</p>

"354631","More autonomy turned out to be mere rhetoric","/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/more-autonomy-turned-out-be-mere-rhetoric","The rise of academies promised more power for schools – but, with government still clinging to the reins, heads haven’t been able to raise standards as expected. However, this system may yet deliver – if ministers ring the changes, writes James Croft","<p>The Academies Act of 2010 purported to take school autonomy to a new level. The jury is still out on whether this could make a difference for pupil outcomes, but doubts have, justifiably, begun to emerge.</p>

<p>While there is evidence of a positive impact in pre-2010 sponsored academies, recent research from the London School of Economics finds no trace of post-conversion improvement in previously “good”, “satisfactory” or “inadequate” converters, as well as a concerning degree of heterogeneity.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the reality seems to be dawning on headteachers that the new autonomy promised does not amount to much. Responses to the 2015 Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) survey revealed a widespread perception that, when it comes to resourcing and curriculum decisions, there’s no real difference in the degree of autonomy between academies and maintained schools.</p>

<p>In a new report, <em>Optimising Autonomy</em>, published recently by the Centre for Education Economics, I consider what may lie behind these findings.</p>

<p>In 2010, the Conservatives brought to government far-reaching plans for education, involving supply-side reforms and significant changes to curriculum and qualifications. But while the political rhetoric emphasised academy freedoms, the emphasis of the legislation, and of academy funding agreements, shifted to underscore the conditional nature of schools’ autonomy, and the powers of intervention afforded the secretary of state in the event of things not going according to plan. The result has been that “autonomy reforms” have steadily given way to a more centralised and interventionist approach.</p>

<p>In consideration of present arrangements, the report says that the current accountability framework offers little reason to believe that significant innovation and improvement will ensue from the reforms undertaken since 2010.</p>

<p>Competition is blunted because success is overly determined by league tables and other accountability measures that focus on too narrow a range of subjects.</p>

<p>The government’s nationalising approach to curriculum and qualifications reform, while predicated on solid research on knowledge-led, traditional teaching methods, looks past other research on the effectiveness of some modern methods for developing reasoning skills, and the fact that we do not yet know what the balance of skills required in the future job market will be. Schools and parents have been largely excluded from having a say over the trade-offs involved in decisions about curriculum content and qualifications.</p>

<h2>Unhealthy competition</h2>

<p>Without parent choice to harness and discipline it, competition is prone to go awry, and even more likely to do so in the kind of certification and accountability regime that we currently have in England. GCSE scores cannot provide adequate data for assessing institutions – or national-level improvement – because the “comparable outcomes” approach taken by Ofqual to awarding effectively puts a cap on overall attainment.</p>

<p>This is why we need international assessments like Pisa and the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (Timss), and the National Reference Test, for benchmarking and corrective purposes, to help us detect the learning gains that GCSEs cannot.</p>

<p>As things stand, however, the pressure that accountability goals place on GCSE certification leaves teachers and heads demotivated and vulnerable to short-termism, gaming, and worse.</p>

<p>These problems are exacerbated by a poorly designed system of intervention that cannot be other than weak in relation to the potential for rent-seeking and cronyism. The essentially network-based nature of brokering, therefore, has negative consequences for competition. It also, and more profoundly, runs the risk of poor sponsor fit.</p>

<p>The report makes a number of recommendations for improvements. Changing our approach to general certification by resetting the national curriculum requirement to a minimum standard, leaving Ofsted to assess curriculum quality on the basis of what we know from evidence and introducing a US-style secondary school diploma to place greater emphasis on institutional quality would be a good starting place. Though safeguards would need to be in place (as in many US states), to guard against the inflationary effect of teacher assessment.</p>

<p>On this model, the role of GCSEs changes: students would in general probably take fewer of them, with a core of key subjects, but it would leave wider scope for exploration ofdifferent subjects and pathways, while allowing for the demonstration of some early specialism, too – to take further, or not, at A level.</p>

<p>At the same time, retention of national competency-based testing at 11 and its introduction at 16, should provide the data necessary for a separate value-added estimation exercise for accountability purposes. This could usefully augment Ofsted assessment validated with reference to what has been established in research.</p>

<p>In respect of the system of oversight predicated on these arrangements, there should be much more emphasis on parent accountability, choice and competition. This means:</p>

<p>* Implementing a national funding formula.</p>

<p>* Increasing the premium for disadvantaged pupils to attract the right new operators to areas of poor provision.</p>

<p>* Phasing out the use of additional funding streams and caps to control the growth of academy chains, so that effective innovators can scale.</p>

<p>Competition and reputation mechanisms should be supported further by allowance for full rationalisation at MAT level, directing funding to them, and giving them fuller resource autonomy. Greater parent accountability would be further facilitated by a voucher, open admissions, simplification of the admissions code via the introduction of lotteries for oversubscription, and investment in school transportation.</p>

<p>It is important to stress that none of this obviates the need for public accountability. It is right that schools should be held accountable for the way they use their resources, and for pupil outcomes. But accountability makes most sense when those being held accountable can actually make a difference to outcomes – through properly conducted experiments and informed response to judgements.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the confused and conflicted nature of oversight has left leaders largely impotent in these and many other respects – a reality that carries potentially serious consequences with respect to the likelihood that autonomy reforms can ultimately prove successful.</p>

<p>Reform of school oversight should begin with a clear delineation of the responsibilities of the various agencies involved. At a basic level, the national schools commissioner (NSC) has responsibility for anticipating need, shaping future provision and managing takeovers where intervention is required. Ofsted’s job is to monitor and inspect standards in schools.</p>

<p>This being the case, it is Ofsted that should be supplying the justification for regional school commissioner (RSC) intervention, not the Department for Education.</p>

<p>Where this is given, an open tendering framework should decide which sponsors/MATs, and/or other kinds of providers, should take over the school in question. If the NSC and his deputies were to make independent appointments, we could achieve both greater transparency and more effective competition between providers than under the present brokering system.</p>

<p>Importantly, the scope of these briefs is such that neither the Education Funding Agency nor local authorities need be involved in oversight: their responsibilities in this regard would pass naturally to Ofsted. There is a strong case for removing to RSCs the statutory basis of LA involvement in place-planning and school improvement as well.</p>

<p>Overall, the current system is not one that can produce transformational change. Among academy leaders, those supposedly in the vanguard of reform, there is a growing feeling that – if at any time it was – it is no longer justifiable that more should be expected of them than others. And there is little point in maintaining the apparatus in its current state of repair.</p>

<p>But that is not an argument for abandoning what we have started. Instead, we must invest in optimising autonomy by resetting and better supporting reforms already in train.</p>

<p>The research looked at early plans to create 12 <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/government-unveils-six-new-opportunity-areas-target-schools-social"">""opportunity areas"",</a> which are aimed at improving schools and supporting teachers in disadvantaged parts of the country.</p>

<p>The £72 million scheme was <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/justine-greening-announces-ps60-million-target-schools-social"">announced</a> with fanfare by education secretary Justine Greening last year as a way of boosting ""social mobility cold spots"".</p>

<p>According to a summary of a research paper, published today, a key risk attached to the programme is ""unrealistic expectations"".</p>

<h2>'Expectations may be too high'</h2>

<p>The research involved an analysis of the early implementation plans produced by each opportunity area, as well as consultations with DfE analysts and policymakers, and a literature review.</p>

<p>The summary states: ""There is a danger that expectations of programme impact may be set too high.""</p>

<p>It adds: ""Given the diverse and overlapping nature of the interventions, it is unlikely that any impact against the headline indicators at local area level will be detected by 2020.""</p>

<p>Therefore, it says: ""It might be necessary to set a longer time horizon to allow sufficient headline outcomes to materialise.""</p>

<p>The research also finds that clarity will be needed on the most consistent measures for judging the project's success in individual areas.</p>

<p>The document says: ""Within the opportunity area programme there is a danger of introducing a disconnect between what local programmes are seeking to achieve and how they will ultimately be assessed by the end of the evaluation.""</p>

<p>The findings will feed into the way the programme is evaluated, the paper states.</p>

The resulting book may be too rude for teachers, our reviewers say","<p><strong>Title: Old MacDonald Heard a Parp<br />
Author and illustrator: Olaf Falafel<br />
Publisher: HarperCollins Children's Books</strong></p>

<h2>Teacher and pupil review</h2>

<p>When this book landed on our doormat at school, it was met with some hesitant reactions from teaching colleagues. Some could immediately see the potential for humour, while others were less convinced.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.olaffalafel.com/"">Olaf Falafel</a> is a surrealist comedian and illustrator, who has also enjoyed fame with his short online videos. In his version of <em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFX98pqzb3o"">Old MacDonald Had a Farm</a></em>, Old Macdonald spends his time tracking down the culprit of a lot of parping, coming from all over the farm.</p>

<p>The parps all sound very different, but the story comes with a handy guide on how to make the sounds. There’s a parp from a goat, from a duck, from a horse, from a unicorn (but that was just in his dream), from a pig and, in the end, one from an additional character that the children were surprised to see. The Quails class won’t spoil the end for you, but it’s worth the wait.</p>

<h3><strong>Too rude for teachers</strong></h3>

<p>When we told the story at school, it ended up in a hilarious <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/literacy"">storytime</a>, with everyone (including some of those hesitant colleagues) joining in. The children loved the fact that they thought this book was too rude for some teachers. We hid the book behind others on the bookshelf to avoid any other teachers becoming embarrassed by it. This led to lots of talk between the children about the story and characters.</p>

<p>Oscar, 4, said: “It’s too rude for Mrs Foster to read, so we have to hide it away.” And five-year-old Maddie said she loved making all the rude sounds for all the different animals.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://youthedaddy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Old-MacDonald-Heard-A-Parp_Spread-3-1600x799.png"">illustrations are engaging and colourful</a>, and after a number of storytimes the children still found new things to spot on each page. Having read the story a number of times, Zach, 4, suggested that “we could actually sing this one, too”. We did this, and so the story became part of our rhyme times as well as story time.</p>

<h3><strong>Half-approval</strong></h3>

<p>Having had the book in the classroom for a number of weeks now, it hasn’t had the lasting impact that other stories have had. Some children have chosen to take it from the library and a small number have asked for it again, but not in the numbers that we have had for <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/author/matt-perrett"">other books we reviewed for Tes</a>.</p>

<p>When we asked the children, after a few weeks, about the book, just over half said they would give it the full thumbs-up. Others said they liked it, but would choose another book to read. Staff certainly agreed that it would be a good story to start a project about farm animals, or one to add to a rhyme basket of songs to sing.</p>

<p>The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) is calling on the government to ensure local authorities are provided with the funds needed for fully-staffed school nursing services.</p>

<p>It says the loss of school nurses is leaving teachers without vital training, and pupils without necessary support.</p>

<p>The continued deterioration of services could leave pupils with health conditions unable to attend mainstream school, the RCN has warned.</p>

<p>According to data published by the NHS this week, more than 550 school nurses were lost between May 2010 and May this year, almost a fifth (19 per cent) of the total NHS workforce in England.</p>

<p>The fall has gathered pace in recent months, with more than a hundred posts lost so far this year.</p>

<p>Lisa Thurston's son Owen developed epilepsy when he was at primary school and his condition became more severe as he got older.</p>

<p>She said: ""The school's support in Owen's care was absolutely critical. When Owen was diagnosed in 2010, the school nursing team provided free training to ensure the school staff had the skills in emergency care to help Owen if and when he needed it.</p>

<p>""We were very lucky that Owen got this crucial care, but diminishing school nursing teams will have a serious impact on similar children with health conditions.""</p>

<p>She added: ""As a parent and a school governor, it is frightening to see the difference between statutory guidance and what care is actually available.</p>

<p>""Every child deserves to be safe at school and without the right health care staff I just don't think this will be the case.""</p>

<p>Almost a quarter of 11- to 15-year-olds in England report have a long term illness or disability, including asthma, diabetes, epilepsy and arthritis.</p>

<p>Despite new statutory guidance from the Department for Education in 2014, which stated that all children with health conditions should be supported to go to school, the number of school nurses has fallen from 2,987 to just 2,433 full-time NHS posts in England.</p>

<p>Fiona Smith, RCN professional lead for children and young people's nursing, said: ""Children with conditions such as asthma, epilepsy or allergies could experience a life-threatening emergency at any time.</p>

<p>""Without the right training, guidance and support from school nursing services, teachers could be completely unprepared for this kind of situation – putting children's lives at serious risk.""</p>

<p>She added: ""It is time the government wakes up and realises the hugely detrimental impact these cuts are having to our children and our society. School nursing is a critical service and it needs to be treated as such.""</p>

<p>Kevin Courtney, general secretary of the NUT teaching union, said:""The drop in the numbers of school nurses is yet another symptom of the school funding crisis.</p>

<p>""It is simply untenable that head teachers should have to continue to struggle on with a situation that is so negatively affecting both the education and wellbeing of our children and young people.""</p>

<p>In reading, which teachers said was a <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/sats-reading-test-kinder-last-year"">""kinder"" test</a> this year than in 2016, local authority results ranged from 61 per cent reaching the expected standard to 86 per cent. This is a range of 25 percentage points and the widest range of any of the subjects – but down from a gap of 29 percentage points last year.</p>

<p> Writing results, which are teacher-assessed, ranged from 67 per cent to 85 per cent reaching the expected standard. The gap has shrunk from 26 percentage points to 18.</p>

<p>And in maths, the range was from 67 per cent 88 per cent – a gap of 21 percentage points, down from 25 last year.</p>

<p>Last year, the local authority Sats scores exacerbated concerns about whether the moderation of writing had been consistent across the country. Rebecca Allen, director of Education Datalab, said then that it may be ""safer"" to <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/judging-schools-todays-sats-writing-scores-may-be-unsafe-data-expert"">judge schools on reading and maths alone</a>. She highlighted the fact that some authorities had very high writing scores, taking into account their reading performance. In contrast, some other authorities had low writing scores, given their reading performance.</p>

<p>In response to these concerns, the government introduced mandatory training and a test for moderators – but Tes revealed earlier this year that two in three moderators had <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/exclusive-more-sats-chaos-two-thirds-moderators-fail-assess-pupils"">incorrectly assessed pupils when tested</a>. And education secretary Justine Greening confirmed in July <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/sats-writing-assessment-changes-need-time-bed-says-greening"">that schools would not be judged on writing, or any other single piece of data, alone.</a></p>

<h2>'Pupils have responded well to the changes'</h2>

<p>The statistics published today also show that 65 per cent girls achieved the expected standard in all of reading, writing and maths, compared with 57 per cent of boys.</p>

<p>Last year 57 per cent of girls achieved the expected standard in all of reading, writing and maths, compared with 50 per cent of boys.</p>

<p>The local authority results come after the<a href=""http://https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/sats-61-cent-pupils-reach-expected-standard-three-rs""> national results were published earlier this year</a>. These revealed that 61 per cent of children had reached the expected standard in reading, writing and mathematics – a rise from 53 per cent reaching the expected standard in the previous year, which had been the first year of the new Sats.</p>

<p>The school level results will be published in December.</p>

<p>Nick Gibb, school standards minister, said: ""Today's results demonstrate that teachers and pupils have responded well to the new, more demanding primary school curriculum.</p>

<p>""Overall, the proportion of pupils reaching the expected standard has improved by 8 percentage points, with almost a third of pupils reaching the higher standard in the challenging grammar, punctuation and spelling test. Thanks to the government's reforms and the hard work of teachers, pupils are now leaving primary school better prepared for the rigours of secondary school.""</p>

"357922","The FE commissioner’s new guiding role: hatchet man or helping hand?","/news/further-education/breaking-news/fe-commissioners-new-guiding-role-hatchet-man-or-helping-hand","Expert advice to become available as part of an expanded ‘self-improving system’","<p>A radical expansion of <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-news/richard-atkins-appointed-fe-commissioner"">FE commissioner Richard Atkins</a>' role to include support and guidance for struggling colleges is currently being drawn up, Tes<em> </em>can reveal.</p>

<p>At present, Mr Atkins and his team of deputies are drafted in to intervene in cases when a college fails an <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-news/ofstedwatch-latest-ofsted-reports-fe-and-skills"">Ofsted inspection</a>, or is found to be financially inadequate. But now, changes are on the way that would also make the FE commissioner the first port of call for institutions in need of advice and support.</p>

<p>In July, <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/justine-greening-teachers-are-experts-teaching-and-so-i-want"">education secretary Justine Greening</a> announced plans for a £15 million college improvement fund – and that the commissioner’s role was to be extended to take in sixth-form colleges. Now, it has emerged that this is part of a more substantial expansion of the commissioner’s remit.</p>

<p>While the <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-news/eileen-milner-named-new-esfa-chief"">Education and Skills Funding Agency</a> (ESFA) will continue to be responsible for intervening when colleges are in serious financial difficulty, the FE commissioner is expected to be asked take the lead on interventions around the quality of provision.</p>

<p>There will also be a second level of involvement, which will include offering additional assistance to colleges at deemed to be at risk of seeing their performance deteriorate, with a view to addressing problems before they become entrenched. All colleges rated as “requires improvement” by Ofsted are expected to come within the scope of the programme.</p>

<h2><strong>'Helping people who need help in difficult times'</strong></h2>

<p>Under the scheme, expert guidance will be made available from a cadre of “National Leaders of Further Education”. Between 30 and 40 principals and chief executives of successful colleges are expected to be recruited, <em>Tes</em> understands. <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-news/greening-pledges-ps50m-t-level-work-placements"">In her speech</a> to the British Chambers of Commerce during the summer, Greening outlined that these leaders will be “empowered to spread their expert knowledge, as well as mentor and support weaker parts of the system”.</p>

<p>College leaders were due to meet Department for Education officials this week to discuss how the new system of support and intervention might operate, and how to make best use of the allocated £15 million budget over two years.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/author/david-hughes"">David Hughes</a>, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, said: “This is an important move and I think we should all try to make it work. It’s about helping people who need help in difficult times.</p>

<p>“A key element is that it would be voluntary for colleges to come and ask for help. It’s a positive move, but I think it’s going to be difficult to make happen.”</p>

My teachers at<strong> <a href=""https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/xVmXBI92Xaun?domain=skinnersacademy.org.uk""><u>Skinners’ Academy</u></a> </strong>told my mum that I didn’t seem to be able to concentrate. They knew something was wrong.</p>

<p>With exams coming, I knew had to get it sorted.</p>

<p>I visited opticians and doctors to try to get a diagnosis. One doctor said it was <a href=""http://www.tes.com.c.tes.ent.platform.sh/news/school-news/breaking-news/exam-stress-drives-rising-number-teens-counselling"">exam stress </a>that was causing my vision problems!</p>

<p>Finally, I was sent for an MRI scan. I think the doctors had had enough of me bothering them.</p>

<p>It was March. I was told that I had a brain tumour the size of a tennis ball. A slow-growing one, but a tumour. </p>

<p>I was sent to Great Ormond Street Hospital in central London, where surgeons operated. They removed the tumour, which turned out to be benign. Although this was good news, I woke from the operation paralysed down the whole of my right side – face, leg, arm and the hand I needed to write my exam papers. For two weeks, I could only get about in a wheelchair.</p>

<p>Until my diagnosis, I had continued with full-time education, going to school every day. But now I had major decisions to make. Should I forget about my nine GCSEs, recover from the operation and start again next year?</p>

<p>I just knew I didn’t want to wait a year. That wasn’t an option for me.</p>

<p>Everyone at school was behind me deciding what was the best thing to do and how I could do the exams.</p>

<p>With the help of a tutor supplied by Hackney Learning Trust [which runs local education services] and amazing support from my school, I managed it. I couldn’t write and had to have someone to read and write for me in every exam.</p>

<p>Everyone was so supportive at school. (The school motto is ""Be the best you can"" and we're taught that you can achieve your ambitions no matter what.)</p>

<p>So I did what I could. I did most of the exams.</p>

<p>Now, when I think about everything that’s happened, I think “Wow”.</p>

<p>My mum told me that sitting the exams was enough and that exams don’t define who you are.</p>

<p>But my recovery still isn’t complete. I can walk unaided now, but my body is still weak. I’m having a lot of therapy. The doctors say that recovery can take up to a year.</p>

<p><em>Ozge Parin, a student at Skinners’ Academy in Hackney, went on to achieve GCSEs in Turkish (A*), English literature (7 – equivalent to an A), business studies (B), health and social care (B), English language (5), maths (4), science core (C), science additional (C). She is about to return to <a href=""https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/xVmXBI92Xaun?domain=skinnersacademy.org.uk""><u>Skinners’ Academy</u></a> </em><em>to begin</em><em> a BTec business studies Level 3 extended diploma and Turkish A level. </em></p>

<p>Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the <a href=""https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjlruCL34HWAhVpLcAKHQg2BHIQFggoMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tes.com%2Fnews%2Fschool-news%2Fbreaking-news%2Fatl-and-nut-merge-and-form-a-new-education-super-union&usg=AFQjCNHoY3e92rc7Vgj6Ksg-3Z5RwKyiqA"">National Education Union</a>, said the organisation would also have to “mobilise effectively” to get over a strike-busting trade union law.</p>

<p>The comments came in an exclusive first interview with the new union's joint leaders, Ms Bousted and Kevin Courtney.</p>

<p>The ATL and the NUT teaching unions officially amalgamated today to form the NEU. With a membership of over 450,000 people, it is the largest education union in Europe, the fourth largest union in the TUC, and encompasses a majority of all teachers.</p>

<p>“Kevin and I are really ambitious and we’ve both said that the NEU will be a <a href=""https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiZ_uDL34HWAhXJCMAKHfs4Cs8QFggoMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tes.com%2Fnews%2Fschool-news%2Fbreaking-news%2Fexclusive-new-teaching-superunion-a-game-changer-leaders-claim&usg=AFQjCNHlLNkAMRYFkWL8eXU-BqH6jwwBrg"">game-changer</a>,"" Ms Bousted told <em>Tes</em>.</p>

<p>However, questions remain over whether the new union will be prevented from taking national industrial action because of legislation introduced by the government last year. Under the Trade Union Act 2016, to take industrial action public sector unions must pass a “double threshold”, with 50 per cent of all eligible members returning their ballot papers and 40 per cent of all members voting ‘yes’ to the action.</p>

<p>Asked whether the NEU would be able to surmount the double threshold, Ms Bousted said: “There is no doubt that the Tory anti-trade union law has improperly restricted the right of public sector workers to take industrial action. Our response to that is that if you put the threshold that high, we will work to organise.”</p>

<p>“I’m certainly not saying there won’t ever be national industrial action again. The issue would have to be absolutely critical and we would have to mobilise effectively.”</p>

<p>She said it was likely that the nature of industrial action would change, with an increase in “school-by-school action” where it is easier to achieve the thresholds.</p>

<p>Mr Courtney said the Trade Union Act was “extremely undemocratic”.</p>

<p>“The Brexit referendum didn’t meet the thresholds – it didn’t get 40 per cent of eligible voters in favour of Leave,"" he said.</p>

<p>“So you can leave an institution you’ve been part of for 50 years but we can’t call a one-day strike that our members don’t have to take part in on the basis of the same vote.”</p>

<p>Mr Courtney also said the NEU would be able to meet the thresholds and take industrial action at a multi-academy trust level if necessary.</p>

<p>""There’s absolutely no reason we wouldn’t do that in a MAT where the issue was a trust-wide issue,” he said.</p>

<p style=""margin: 0px;"">However, Mr Courtney said he believed it was still “possible to reach those thresholds at a national level”, pointing out that ATL and NUT reached them in 1992 in a Sats ballot.</p>

<p>The NEU leaders identified the “funding crisis” and “overwhelming” workload as key priorities for the new union.</p>

<p>Ms Bousted said <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/school-cuts-campaign-influenced-countless-voters-its-a-lesson-how"">the unions’ school cuts campaign</a> during the general election showed that providing information to parents could be a more effective way of getting the government to change course on funding than industrial action.</p>

<p>“It’s not industrial action, it’s information that persuaded <a href=""https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjLp76934HWAhVHCsAKHTsSB3AQFggoMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tes.com%2Fnews%2Fschool-news%2Fbreaking-news%2Fschools-get-a-ps13-billion-funding-boost&usg=AFQjCNGSSJ5F9-tUpr7hKeQayZlE0bG_Hw"">the government to put the extra £1.3 billion in</a>,” she said.</p>

<p>“My view is that if you’re looking at education funding, the power of information, campaigning and the moral case you can make is extremely powerful. I think for funding that’s probably a more effective route.”</p>

"358675","Book review: The Reading Mind by Daniel T Willingham","/news/school-news/breaking-views/book-review-reading-mind-daniel-t-willingham","This succinct read is the perfect start-of-term reminder of why learning to read is exciting, says David James","<p><strong>Title: <em>The Reading Mind: a cognitive approach to understanding how the mind reads</em><br />
Author: Daniel T Willingham<br />
Publisher: Jossey-Bass<br />
256pp, £21.99 (hardback)<br />
ISBN: 9781119301370</strong></p>

<p>For teachers who lean towards the “traditional” approach to teaching, Dan Willingham is the man who started the fightback against “progressivism”.</p>

<p>His book <em>Why Don’t Students Like School?</em> (2009) articulated ideas that many in the profession believed to be true, provable and (crucially), transferable.</p>

<p>For Willingham, “memory is the residue of thought” and thinking is something human beings have to be trained to do in a disciplined manner. For him, subject-specific knowledge is the bedrock of critical inquiry. Claiming such things now seems uncontroversial, but written at a time when teachers were being told to practise brain-gym exercises, or to think about learning styles, such statements seemed almost heretical.</p>

<p>Willingham’s latest book is typically readable, and this is not to be underestimated when you consider the complexity of the subject he is exploring.</p>

<p>Indeed, his style can be almost conversational at times, allowing words such as “yup” to reaffirm his original statement. You begin to notice the granular detail of his writing because he is constantly drawing attention to the cognitive machinery behind the black lines on the page. For him, reading is close to being a prosaic, everyday miracle of human creation and interpretation.</p>

<p>In fact, we often take it for granted until we start thinking about it: and when we do think anew about the process new complexities quickly emerge, which in turn is innately problematic because language is an essential part of our individual and collective identities. Thinking again about language means thinking again about our innate selves. So, it is easier to not think about such things. Or, as Willingham points out early on, “Reading...calls on so many mental processes that an agenda to provide a cognitive explanation comes perilously close to the goal ‘I’m gonna explain the mind’. There’s too much.”</p>

<h2>Fascinating journey</h2>

<p>Well, there’s not too much of this very succinct book: of its 256 pages, approximately 78 are made up of references, discussion questions, “summaries and implications”, and the index. And there are whole pages given over to diagrams, charts, and other graphics that illustrate various points. Indeed, each chapter is prefaced with its very own agenda. This is not a serious complaint: indeed, so abstruse are some of those points that diagrams are essential for clarifying relation and causality, and this is especially the case when he writes about pictographs and logographs.</p>

<p>Perhaps inevitably, the book reads like a circuitous – but fascinating – journey to get back to where we started out, accompanied by a hugely informed and interesting guide who is keen to hold your hand and explain things several times over to check you’ve understood it all.</p>

<p>And the views unveiled on this journey remind the reader just how astonishingly complex language acquisition is (for instance, Willingham describes how and why it is “impossible to say p in isolation”, and after you’ve read this it changes how you view something so familiar for ever). And his explanation of how and why prosody as well as orthographic representation matter are so crucial to conveying meaning is essential reading for anyone interested in learning (as an English teacher, I felt I was learning something new on every page). And hugely knowledgeable though Willingham is, he is also winningly modest about his own lack of understanding in certain areas: we join him on his desire to know more about how we learn words, and how we use them.</p>

<p>The Reading Mind is a book for all teachers, because we are all teachers of language. And whether you are an NQT in English or a head of maths, this book will remind you of how little we know about our reading minds, and from that realisation comes the pleasure of discovery. It is also reassuring to be told how fundamental reading is to academic progress: the auditory and visual decoding that we engage in every day, and retains its transformative power within the mind, allows us to share the most intimate of ideas with strangers.</p>

<p>Inculcating a reading attitude in a child is one of the biggest challenge a parent, or a teacher, faces, but the rewards are endless. It is salutary, at the start of the new academic year, to be reminded by someone who retains that propensity to be excited by this strange, beguiling alchemy.</p>

"358738","An inspector calls ... but only once every 10 years","/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/inspector-calls-only-once-every-10-years","Call for a review of the inspection system as fears are raised about outdated reports","<p>A significant number of Scottish schools are going a decade or more without being inspected – and some schools have not had an inspector call since 2004, a <em>Tes Scotland</em> investigation reveals.</p>

<p>Critics of the inspection process have suggested that inspection reports are irrelevant after five years and that high-performing schools could even take legal action if they felt their reputation was tainted by an outdated report from another era.</p>

<p>However, Education Scotland pointed out that local authorities and the schools themselves were also responsible for maintaining standards between inspection reports.</p>

<p><em>Tes Scotland</em> looked at the last time inspection reports were published for over 500 primaries and secondaries in a diverse range of councils: Glasgow, Falkirk, Highland, Moray and Shetland. There are 2,034 primaries and 359 secondaries in Scotland in total.</p>

<p>Overall, the figures for the five councils show that 15 per cent of primaries had not had an inspection report published for a decade or more (67 out of 436). Three secondaries had not been inspected for a decade – St Paul’s High in Glasgow, and Mallaig High and Dingwall Academy in Highland.</p>

<p>The school that had not been inspected for the longest was Canna Primary in Highland, which had an inspection report dating back to 2002. The school was mothballed for three years until it reopened in 2014, when two families moved to the National Trust-owned island.</p>

<p><img height=""827"" width=""1000"" class=""media-element file-default img-responsive"" typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""https://tes.com/sites/default/files/tess080917_06_stats.png"" alt="""" /></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Two schools had inspection reports dating back to 2004: Whiteinch Primary in Glasgow and Staffin Primary in Highland. Back then, US president Donald Trump was a new reality TV star, Facebook had only just been founded and the inspectorate was still seven years away from merging with Learning and Teaching Scotland.</p>

<p>Overall, the frequency of inspection has dropped by more than 50 per cent, from 362 inspections in 2008-09 to 161 in 2016-17. Last year, just 19 secondaries were inspected, while in 2008-09 some 61 secondaries were inspected.</p>

<p><em>Tes Scotland</em> also looked at all the 300-plus primaries and secondaries inspected in 2008-09 and found that, eight years on, none of them had undergone a full inspection since – although for the schools that had continued to engage with Education Scotland more recent follow-up reports were available.</p>

<p>Conservative shadow education secretary Liz Smith said the frequency of inspection was “a serious concern”.</p>

<p>She added: “In some cases pupils could go right through their school career without any inspection taking place. I’m sure parents will find that unacceptable.”</p>

<p>Responding to the <em>Tes Scotland</em> findings, Keir Bloomer – education committee convener at Scotland’s national academy of science and letters, the Royal Society of Edinburgh – called for the role of the inspectorate to be reviewed. When the inspectorate was set up over 100 years ago its purpose was clear but inspections are now “too infrequent to fulfil that role satisfactorily”, he said.</p>

<p>He called for Education Scotland – which has also been criticised for over-inspection in recent times – to remove any reports more than five years old from its website, saying that the information could be “actively misleading”; this call was echoed by primary school leaders’ body the AHDS.</p>

<h2>Threat of court action</h2>

<p>Mr Bloomer, who is also a former director of education, suggested that “a much-improved school with an outdated, damning report” could take Education Scotland to court to have the report taken down.</p>

<p>“The time has probably come to conduct a serious review – that is, a serious research and evidence-based investigation, not a trivial consultation – into whether this particular 19th-century mechanism has a useful future role and what that role might be,” he said.</p>

<p>Greg Dempster, general secretary of AHDS, said many inspection reports painted an “artificial picture” of a school because they captured “a moment in time” and quickly dated.</p>

<p>He agreed that reports should be taken down after around five years. However, more frequent inspection was not the answer, he argued. “We want a system of inspection that is focused on the local authority level and how well they know their schools and their ability to support their schools’ development because they are the ones in and out of schools all the time supporting, directing and encouraging them,” said Mr Dempster.</p>

<p>An Education Scotland spokeswoman said that, in Scotland, there is a three-level approach to evaluating and improving education. Schools have a responsibility to evaluate their performance, local authorities have statutory duties around quality improvement and reporting, and the third level is inspection.</p>

<p>She said that schools were inspected on “a proportionate basis and not on a cyclical basis” and that schools were selected for inspection based on a representative sample, or on risk.</p>

<p>She added: “The Scottish new standards and evaluation framework as specified within the National Improvement Framework and Improvement Plan will set expectations on the focus and frequency of school inspection carried out by Education Scotland in future.”</p>

<p>Public Health England (PHE) has launched lesson plans for teachers to use in their <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/pshe"">personal, social, health and economic</a> education (PSHE) classes.</p>

<p>These lesson plans cover topics such as <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/too-often-bullies-are-empowered-schools-fail-effectively-sanction"">bullying</a> and <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/school-cyberbullies-more-likely-attempt-suicide"">cyberbullying</a>, alcohol and smoking, creating positive relationships and friendships, <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/drive-better-results-schools-damaging-pupils-mental-health"">exam stress</a>, online stress, social media and <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/teachers-are-right-warn-parents-watch-what-they-say-about-body-image"">body image</a>.</p>

<p>PHE said that the lessons will help build ""crucial life skills for young people to boost their resilience and improve their mental health and <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/wellbeing"">wellbeing</a>"".</p>

<h2>'Diverse challenges'</h2>

<p>Professor John Newton, director of health improvement at PHE, said: ""As natives of the social media world, young people have to navigate a minefield of challenges, while enjoying the benefits of technology.</p>

<p>""The new resources will help young people to develop coping mechanisms and life skills to deal with diverse challenges, from cyberbullying and exam stress to body image, in a digital world.""</p>

<p>The lessons are part of the Rise Above for Schools programme, which enables teachers to access content from <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/joe-wicks-a-mission-get-your-pupils-and-you-fit-hiit"">vloggers and YouTubers</a> to encourage young people to talk about the things that matter to them.</p>

<p>Jenny Fox, PSHE Association subject specialist, said: ""Young people today face a range of new pressures that can potentially harm their emotional and physical wellbeing.</p>

<p>""By addressing these key issues, resources from Rise Above for Schools support the important role PSHE education plays in helping young people to make positive, informed choices throughout their lives.</p>

<p>""The lesson plans provide opportunities for students to engage in active learning and to discuss and reflect upon the social and emotional aspects of issues they face on a daily basis.</p>

<p>""The lessons are consistently well-matched to the needs of young people and enable them to demonstrate progress as their understanding and skills develop.""</p>

<h2>'Prepared for life'</h2>

<p>School standards minister Nick Gibb said: ""It is important young people are taught the knowledge they need to stay safe and healthy, and leave school prepared for life in modern Britain.</p>

<p>""High-quality PSHE teaching has a vital role to play in giving young people a better understanding of the society around them.</p>

"359494","How applied English could help students take off","/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/how-applied-english-could-help-students-take","A specially tailored English course improved performance and enjoyment","<p>It’s no secret that compulsory GCSE resits are causing further education colleges a major headache as they contend with scarce resources, often disaffected students, and low success rates, as seen in the most recent GCSE results only a matter of weeks ago.</p>

<p>According to a recent study, between the ages of 16 and 19, only 13 per cent of students in general further education colleges achieve a grade C or above when resitting English, while only 5 per cent achieve a grade C or above in maths.</p>

<p>One of the most persuasive themes amid calls for reform of the resit system comes from those looking for “applied” versions of maths and English specifically tailored for those studying vocational courses.</p>

<p>This year, the technology campus at Activate Learning, where I work, piloted an applied IGCSE English course developed and delivered in partnership with a civil engineering firm and aimed specifically at students studying level 1, 2, and 3 courses in construction, plumbing, motor vehicle maintenance, and engineering.</p>

<h2>Engaging employers</h2>

<p>We wanted to create an IGCSE that went beyond business as usual, giving those students who had struggled with English at school a fresh new perspective on the subject and we wanted to prepare them for work and for citizenship in a world beyond education.</p>

<p>Our approach to directly engaging employers in the design of the course and by inviting them into the classroom was motivated by a range of factors.</p>

<p>Studies have shown that students are more likely to engage with and succeed in English and in maths if work is contextualised and they can see its relevance.</p>

<p>Employers are well placed to show and not just tell students about the relevance of the skills they are learning. This appears particularly important because a troubling 46 per cent of employers are apparently concerned about young people’s command of English. By engaging with employers we, and the students, are able to find out which skills they really need to be developing. Finally, there is the striking finding that students who have four or more positive experiences with employers while in education are 86 per cent less likely to be NEET.</p>

<p>For 12 weeks, 37 students worked on a project that required them to explore, from a local perspective, the current UK housing crisis and to identify a suitable location for 2,000 new homes in Oxfordshire. Working in teams, they developed their reading skills while looking at newspaper articles on the crisis, reading diary entries about flooding in the area, studying technical manuals relating to soil types and drainage systems, engaging with the local council’s strategic plan, and considering the NHS’s Healthy New Towns strategy.</p>

<p>Once their research was complete, the students compiled reports for submission to the engineering firm, recommending sites for development. This work required them to hone their persuasive and formal writing skills and to plan and redraft and redraft again until they were satisfied they had work they could present to a “real life” audience.</p>

<p>Throughout this process, the employers supported the students, introducing the project at the beginning and paying monthly visits to the classroom to provide feedback and answer questions. On the completion of the project, they listened to formal presentations delivered by the students, judged the final reports produced by the teams, and awarded a week’s work experience to the winners.</p>

<p>As a result of the project, students reported feeling more motivated to study English and they were more likely to say they enjoyed the subject, findings apparently borne out by a 5 per cent increase in attendance.</p>

<p>Students were also more likely to report seeing the relevance of studying English beyond securing their C grade. In their IGCSE English exams, 76 per cent of the students made at least one grade worth of progress and 62 per cent secured a grade C, compared with 47 per cent in Activate Learning colleges last year.</p>

<p>While the softer skills we sought to enhance by the project are less easy to measure, the employers were impressed by the students reasoning and communication skills and they said their preconceptions of level 1 and 2 students had been challenged by the experience.</p>

<p>We are now looking to build on what we learned from this project, developing this approach within the college’s technology faculty so that elements of both our maths and English GCSE courses are delivered in this way across three campuses.</p>

"359557","The e-Sgoil is ‘a reason to come back to teaching’","/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/e-sgoil-a-reason-come-back-teaching","Virtual-teacher platform designed for island schools spreads across the country","<p>A project that allows lessons to be beamed into Scottish classrooms has been described as “one of the best things” happening in Scottish education by a former education director who has conducted an independent review of the scheme.</p>

<p>The e-Sgoil – or e-school – based in the Western Isles became a reality at the beginning of 2016-17 to help tackle the teacher shortage, particularly in Gaelic, and to give secondary pupils in remote and rural schools a wider range of subjects.</p>

<p>It has helped the authority to deliver new subjects and to continue to deliver courses in the face of staff absences – a supply teacher from Dumbarton delivered chemistry lessons to pupils on Harris, for example. It has also bailed out other councils when delivery was under threat because of a lack of teachers in certain subject areas.</p>

<p>The e-Sgoil secured £500,000 in Scottish government funding – matched by Western Isles Council – so has a national remit.</p>

<h2>‘Adding value’</h2>

<p>Bruce Robertson – former education director in both Highland and Aberdeenshire – has told <em>Tes Scotland</em> that the scheme is something Scotland should be “hugely proud of”. The e-Sgoil was starting to bring a wider range of subjects to remote schools, but it is also of relevance to urban authorities, he said.</p>

<p>“This is not about replacing teachers, but adding to the value of the work of schools,” said Mr Robertson. “The issue is making sure there are a wealth of learning opportunities at your fingertips, no matter where you are.”</p>

<p>He believes the e-Sgoil could slow population decline and strengthen the economy by allowing more people to live, learn and work in the Western Isles.</p>

<p><img height=""1436"" width=""1000"" class=""media-element file-default img-responsive"" typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""https://tes.com/sites/default/files/tess150917_12_stats.png"" alt="""" /></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Concerns were expressed that the virtual school might lead to a decrease in the number of teachers, but quite the opposite has happened, according to e-Sgoil headteacher Angus Maclennan. Now the school has around 10 teachers on its books, one of whom is full-time, he said.</p>

<p>Mr Maclennan added: “A lot of people who were anti the e-Sgoil said there was going to be fewer teachers. That’s wrong. We have added to the teaching workforce and given people a reason and an opportunity to come back into the teaching profession.” Connectivity was an issue for some schools but, with that in place, all that is needed to get a teacher into a classroom is conference software Vscene and Glow, the digital network for Scottish schools. One teacher has even delivered lessons to schools in the Western Isles from a hotel room in Glasgow while attending a family wedding. “The things we have done have not been 100 per cent successful,” said Mr Maclennan. “This is not the answer to all the problems in education – but it’s a very good tool in a box.”</p>

<p>He stressed that the e-Sgoil was not about online learning but about having a teacher in front of a class on a screen “interacting, encouraging, cajoling”.</p>

<p>An EIS teaching union spokesman said that it is best, where possible, for pupils to learn in the same classroom as their teacher, but that the e-Sgoil could be a practical solution in rural or remote areas where there might only be one or two pupils studying a subject.</p>

<p>The spokesman added: “This allows pupils, no matter where they live, to have access to a rich and diverse curriculum in school, which will prepare them for life after education.”</p>

<p><em><strong>Education Scotland’s Joan Esson will present a session on the e-Sgoil at the Scottish Learning Festival in Glasgow on Wednesday from 9.30-10.15am. See <a href=""http://bit.ly/SLFprog"">bit.ly/SLFprog</a></strong></em></p>

However, if we work together... ","<p>Yesterday, at the launch event of the new mental health charity, <a href=""https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/JRlWBf5dlAHK?domain=invincibleme.org.uk""><strong>Invincible Me</strong></a>, Amy Shocker, their inspirational founder, provided the following advice: </p>

<h4>""Fall in love with the problem, not the solution""</h4>

<p>It’s an interesting reflection. How often do we become so invested in a solution that we become unable to take an objective view as to whether it is working? How easy is it to see and hear only what we want to when we’ve invested our heart and soul into an activity or project? How difficult is it to encourage honest appraisal from others for our pet projects, when to receive criticism would be akin to hearing our baby described as ugly?</p>

<p>Over the last few months, I have <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/fairy-tale-short-ofsted-inspection-unlikely-have-a-happy-ending"">been critical of Ofsted for their proposals to change short inspection</a>. Along with many of NAHT’s members, I like short inspection. But as argued elsewhere, I think we need an honest appraisal about whether the cost of new proposal outweighs the benefits. I suspect that, when it comes to short inspection, we may have fallen in love with the solution, not the problem.</p>

<p>Today’s announcement of a new five-year strategy for Ofsted is very welcome, and suggests that the chief inspector has both fallen in love with the complex problems of making Ofsted a force for good while having also had a good look at the barriers that are getting in the way. The ambition that Ofsted should be a force for improvement, and implicit acceptance that they can sometimes act as a brake on progress, is extremely welcome.  Let me draw out three points of particular significance:</p>

<p>Firstly, Ofsted has said that they will work on improving reports to parents – to say more clearly what makes that school distinctive, unique and exceptional and be less reliant on data to do so. We’ve argued long and hard for an acceptance of the inherent limitations of data as an indicator of school effectiveness so this is a step in the right direction.</p>

<p>We’d encourage Ofsted to be bold and go further and remove the ""outstanding"" grade altogether. The grade boundary is so blurred that there is often little that sets many outstanding schools apart from those judged ""good"". A single-word judgement hides the truth that there is much that is exceptional within less-than ""outstanding"" schools, and there is many an Achilles heel within even the most successful schools in receipt of the top judgement. <a href=""https://schoolleaders.thekeysupport.com/school-evaluation-and-improvement/inspection/after-inspection/proposed-changes-to-the-inspection-of-2018good-and-outstanding-schools/"">Research into the impact of grading and key judgements</a> may well open the door to this prospect.</p>

<p>Secondly, <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/ofsted-wants-a-change-law-so-it-can-inspect-multi-academy-trusts"">Ofsted wants to be able to scrutinise multi-academy trusts</a> in the same way as they currently inspect local authorities – we’d strongly agree. The NAHT view is that the trust that runs a MAT should be subject to routine inspection, and such inspections ought to include an element of rigorous financial accountability. However, to get the power to inspect a MAT is likely to require legislation and it is highly unlikely that this would be prioritised and brought forward whilst Brexit dominates parliamentary time.</p>

<p>Thirdly, Ofsted is serious about looking at<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/27/ofsted-veil-threats-wont-help-schools""> the ""Ofsted deterrent"" </a>that dissuades good people from working in tough schools. It has said that it will take a hard look at the validity of judgements and the undesirable incentives emanating from fear of Ofsted. The inspectorate has pledged to get underneath the issue of unconscious bias among inspectors to prevent inaccurate and unfair judgements on schools in disadvantaged areas.</p>

<p>Ending this Ofsted deterrent could be the single most important improvement that could be made to inspection. Encouraging, not dissuading, great people to work in tough schools is key to increasing equity of opportunity between schools and supporting equality of opportunity for all students. These problems run deep, as <a href=""https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/XDwVBfqKwot9?domain=epi.org.uk"">research by the Education Policy Institute</a> demonstrated earlier this year, which suggested that the inspection system may not be fully equitable to schools with challenging intakes.</p>

<p>It is clear that it will take much more than myth-busting to solve this problem.</p>

<p>There has been a seismic shift in approach at <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/exclusive-amanda-spielman-formally-approved-ofsted-chief-inspector"">Ofsted since Amanda Spielman too</a><a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/exclusive-amanda-spielman-formally-approved-ofsted-chief-inspector""><strong>k</strong></a> over from Sir Michael Wilshaw nine months ago. Amanda has shown a strong desire to talk and a willingness to listen. Unlike announcements of old, Ofsted’s new strategy has not been developed in the dark but is the result of open discussion with the profession and leadership associations.</p>

<p>The strategy is well worth a proper and full read, the new chief inspector’s assessment of the challenges is refreshingly honest. There seems a clear desire on the part of to work collaboratively, openly and respectfully with the thousands of professionals who are charged with the responsibility of educating our nation’s children. Our regular discussions with Ofsted will now focus on how its new strategy can be achieved, so that where a school demonstrates particular strengths, this can be recognised for the benefit of that school’s community, and shared so that all schools can benefit from what Ofsted learns in every school it visits.</p>

<p>Ofsted has been seen over many years as the problem, and I don’t think that school leaders have ever fallen in love with it. However, in working together, we hope inspection will cease to be part of the problem, the profession can take ownership of standards as they ought, and everyone will have a stake in arriving at the solution.</p>

"362416","'We need to treasure awe-inspiring school trips – their impact on pupils is immeasurable'","/news/school-news/breaking-views/we-need-treasure-awe-inspiring-school-trips-their-impact-pupils","Giving pupils the opportunity to meet credible authors, illustrators and other arts professionals sparks joy – and even future careers, writes one veteran educational journalist","<p>There was excited chatter from the hundreds of primary school children entering the Old Vic theatre that morning.</p>

<p>The outing was obviously preferable to sitting behind your desk at school studying for your <a href=""http://www.tes.com/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/i-dont-see-point-sats-i-hate-testing-little-people"">Sats exams</a> – even if you did have to brave squally showers to do so.</p>

<p>The pupils, all from primary schools in the area, were at the London theatre for the Children's Book Show to hear from children's authors and illustrators, John Burningham, aged 81, and Judith Kerr, aged 94. (Nice to see the age gap between the authors and their audience meant very little to the children.)</p>

<p>Judith Kerr read from her book, <em>When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit</em>, about how she and her family had escaped from Nazi Germany before the Second World War. Her father was a Jewish journalist hated by the Nazis. Judith revealed how she nearly scuppered their escape attempt by talking too much when a security guard was checking their passports.</p>

<p>""I was 9 at the time,"" Judith told her audience. ""I wouldn't have survived for long – none of us would have done – if I had given the game away. As it was, I've had 85 extra years.""</p>

<p>Asked by the children about her experience, she added: ""I think obviously about the people who didn't get out who would have given anything to have had a similar lifespan to the one that I had.""</p>

<p>There was a faint whiff of naughtiness and anarchy in the air as John talked about how one of his books carried an illustration of a peeing dog which led to it being taken out of 50 libraries and being banned from shops.</p>

<p>Judith revealed that she had failed to gain her qualification in illustration from a further education college while passing her history exam (""a subject I know nothing about"") with flying colours.</p>

<p>It was the sort of admission that would have education traditionalists holding up their hands in horror at the thought of someone credible extolling the virtues of not passing a test (or at least if not exactly extolling the virtues, making a joke of it.)</p>

<p>It was, though, inspirational for the children. They were in awe of the Old Vic, whose history had been explained to them by their teachers, and many of them attending the event harboured aspirations to become writers like John and Judith.</p>

<p>One child sitting next to me, an 11-year-old (I was surrounded in the theatre by a sea of primary schoolchildren) turned to me and asked in a hushed tone: ""Are you an author?""</p>

<p>""Yes,"" I replied truthfully. My first attempt at writing fiction had actually been published that morning, ironically. ""Do you write children's books?"" he asked.  I had to be honest. ""No,"" I said, ""I'm a crime writer."" ""Wow,"" he replied.</p>

<p>I hasten to add I had done nothing to earn this adulation, but it was good to see a young boy inspired by the thought that he might be in the presence of a writer.</p>

<p>Which brings me back to a <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/it-time-we-stopped-mollycoddling-our-pupils"">point I made earlier this summer. </a>We should be treasuring these kinds of school trips – not forcing teachers to cancel them because of <a href=""http://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/millions-pupils-missing-out-trips-away-owing-cost"">a lack of funding</a>. (There were a few spare places in the Old Vic last Friday, although you would not have thought so by the response of the children to the events that were happening.)</p>

<p>Happily, though, the Children's Book Show has secured Arts Council funding for the next four years – thus ensuring that future year groups enjoy the same experience all around the country that these children did.</p>

","<p>There was excited chatter from the hundreds of primary school children entering the Old Vic theatre that morning.</p>

<p>The outing was obviously preferable to sitting behind your desk at school studying for your <a href=""http://www.tes.com/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/i-dont-see-point-sats-i-hate-testing-little-people"">Sats exams</a> – even if you did have to brave squally showers to do so.</p>

"362593","Academic gap between independent and state primaries narrows as fees rise","/news/school-news/breaking-news/academic-gap-between-independent-and-state-primaries-narrows-fees","Rising fees have not produced a greater private-school advantage, study finds ","<p>The academic gap between pupils in independent primary schools and pupils in state primary schools has narrowed – yet the fees for prep schools have escalated, new research suggests.</p>

<p>Attending a private primary school still provides an “early advantage for children over their similarly able peers” in UK state primary schools – even when a wide range of family and individual characteristics are taken into account, according to a <a href=""http://file:///C:/Users/ebusby/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/SWTD17TS/Parsons_et_al-2017-British_Educational_Research_Journal.pdf"">new study from UCL Institute of Education.</a></p>

<p>But parents are now paying more for prep schools than in the 1970s – and their children have a smaller academic lead over pupils in state primary schools than three decades ago.</p>

<p>The study, which looked at three generations of children living in the UK, said: “The fact that increasing school fees have not produced an increased private-school advantage is surprising.</p>

<p>“We can speculate that increased performance pressures on state primary schools may have gone some way to counterbalance the increased resources enjoyed by the private sector.”</p>

<h2>'Very notable gap'</h2>

<p>The research, which used data from three birth cohorts (1958, 1970 and 2000-2001), found the benefit of attending a prep school for academic progress is “not commensurate with the associated costs”.</p>

<p>It concludes: “Parents of the youngest cohort are paying (proportionately) the most, but the benefits were not greater than for the 1970 cohort.”</p>

<p>Pupils in private primary schools in the 1970s had an 8- to 10-point advantage, whereas children in prep schools in the 2000s only had a 5-point advantage, the study finds.</p>

<p>The average fees for sending a child to a private primary school in 2015 were around £12,000 a year, the report says, whereas the annual average government funding per pupil in a state primary school was £4,308.</p>

<p>The report adds: ""Private schools in Britain, unlike their international counterparts, receive no state funding, with the exception of some tax relief, but the cost of attending a private school is increasingly high and the gap in school resources between private and state schools very, very notable.</p>

<p>""One may hypothesise that the increased fees and resources, and generally more benign environment provided by prep schools in more recent years, should have led to better results and a greater comparative advantage over state schools for the more recent cohorts.""</p>

<p>Julie Robinson, general secretary of the Independent Schools Council (ISC), said: ""Affordability is of course a concern for schools and they work hard to remain competitive whilst facing pressures on salaries, pensions and maintenance costs.</p>

<p>""Mindful of the struggles hard-working families face in paying school fees, many schools have extended bursary provision to lower income families.”</p>

<p>In 2017, 70.7 per cent had reached the government’s benchmark of a “good level of development”, compared with <a href=""http://https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/new-early-years-stats-more-5-year-olds-achieve-good-benchmark-and"">69.3 per cent in 2016</a>.</p>

<p>To reach a <a href=""http://https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/early-years-foundation-stage-profile-what-you-need-know"">good level of development</a>, children must have reached the expected level in 12 of the 17 areas in which they are assessed, including being able to count to 20, read simple sentences and take turns when playing.</p>

<p>The same trend was seen in the percentage achieving at least the expected level across all early learning goals – which increased by 1.7 percentage points from 2016.</p>

<h2>Girls still outperform boys</h2>

<p>Girls continue to do better than boys – but the gender gap has decreased for the three key measures.</p>

<p>The gender gap for the percentage of children achieving a good level of development has reduced from 14.7 percentage points in 2016 to 13.7 percentage points in 2017.</p>

<p>The assessment, known as the Early Years Foundation Stage Profile, is based on teachers’ observations of children.</p>

<p>The government has recently proposed <a href=""http://https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/sats-seven-year-olds-be-scrapped-2023"">changes to the profile</a> as part of an overhaul of primary assessment.</p>

<p>The proposals include looking at reducing the number of early learning goals and bringing them into line with maths and phonics teaching in key stage 1. There is also interest in looking at some kind of vocabulary measure.</p>

Sonia Blandford<br />
John Catt<br />
202pp, £14.00 (paperback)<br />
97811911382409</strong></p>

<p>The title of Sonia Blandford’s book is taken from the influential National Children’s Bureau report of the same name, published in 1973, written by Peter Wedge and Hilary Prosser. The authors of the original admitted in their preface that there was no general agreement about what defined social disadvantage, but that “three factors seem fundamentally important: family composition...low income, poor housing”.</p>

<p>Education did not feature. This is where Blandford’s book differs. For her – and probably most readers – education is central to social disadvantage and social mobility.</p>

<p>But what does social mobility look like? For Blandford, it doesn’t mean that the working class aspire to middle-class lifestyles, or to shallow materialism. No, for Blandford, “social mobility involves changing the way people think, act and engage”. Few would disagree with such requirements if they clearly led to tangible progress, but many would ask for a little more detail about the shared goal, if it is not to be defined – and confined – by economics.</p>

<h2>Political problems</h2>

<p>A more important and political question is: who is responsible for redressing social inequality? Broadly speaking, Conservatives see social change as something individuals instigate themselves, whereas Labour – especially Corbynites – see such change as the responsibility of government. Blandford is too astute to align herself with either tribe, but it is clear there is a sense that birth is destiny and the individual, if denied “choices”, is unlikely to see much improvement in their prospects. But is such a view innately middle-class? And is the Tory-socialist divide a false dichotomy used for reductive political ends?</p>

<p>My own family encapsulate the problems of trying to find easy answers in this area. My father started life as a miner in South Wales, and my mother, although clearly bright, left school at 16 to work and then raised her family. A levels, let alone university, were never realistic options for either of them. But both my parents moved up into the middle class through a combination of hard work and the social reforms of post-war governments. I benefitted from their mobility, but my own children cannot take for granted any of the advantages I have, let alone improve on them, which partly explains the political turmoil so many affluent but stagnating economies now find themselves in.</p>

<p>So, Blandford’s book is timely. She raises the right questions, but her answers sometimes lead only to more questions. She writes passionately about “choices” and “inclusion”, but such statements need to be fully explained, costed and detailed. They seldom are. And when she writes that there has to be a “focus on everyone, and at every age”, that is not focus but a wide-angle lens that leaves everything blurred and undefined.</p>

<p>The cornerstone of this “common-sense manifesto” is inclusion. For Blandford, the fact that nearly 6,700 children were permanently excluded from schools in 2015-2016 shames the system. For her, “exclusion in whatever forms is unjust, unnecessary and should be removed from practice in our education system”.</p>

<p>But what would be the consequences of such a change in school policy and practice? What impact would retaining these children have on the education of the children whose lessons they disrupt? How might that help retain the many teachers who leave the profession every year because of disruptive behaviour in the classrooms?</p>

<p>At no point does Blandford blame the parents of the disruptive children for the damage they do, nor are the children considered responsible for their own actions. Society and schools are to blame. They are to blame, too, for curricula that are not “socially and culturally relevant” to all children, which do not “engage children in learning”, a line of argument that eventually leads to cultural relativism and leaves all children impoverished.</p>

<p>Despite my disagreements with Blandford, I ended up respecting her position. She is the personification of social mobility and rather than sitting in an academic ivory tower, she has committed herself to helping others.</p>

<p>Yes, her questions are sometimes unanswered, but that does not mean they should not be asked, or answers not searched for. Given the crisis we are facing, we don’t have any alternative.</p>

<p>The rates have risen from 0.9 per cent in autumn-spring 2015-16 to 1.1 per cent in autumn-spring 2016-17.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/652689/SFR55_2017_text.pdf"">Government data released today</a> said the rise is because of increased levels of unauthorised family holiday and other unauthorised absence. </p>

<p>The percentage of pupils who missed at least one session because of any family holiday – authorised or unauthorised – increased from 7.6 per cent in autumn-spring 2015-16 to 9.4 per cent in autumn-spring 2016-17.</p>

<p>The percentage of all possible sessions missed because of unauthorised family holidays increased from 0.2 per cent in autumn-spring 2015-16 to 0.3 per cent in autumn-spring 2016-17.</p>

<h2>Absence figures 'volatility'</h2>

<p>The figures relate to the period after the <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/dfe-plans-law-change-after-court-backs-man-who-took-daughter-term"">May 2016 High Court judgement</a> that ruled Jon Platt, a father from the Isle of Wight who took his daughter on a week-long trip during term-time to Florida, should not be fined by his local authority.</p>

<p>However, the figures also partly cover the period after the <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/father-loses-landmark-term-time-holiday-case"">April 2017 Supreme Court judgment</a>, which overturned the previous ruling in favour of the local authority.</p>

<p>The document states: ""However, interpretation of any trends should be treated with caution due to the volatility of autumn and spring term absence figures.""</p>

<p>The overall absence rate across state-funded primary and secondary schools also increased slightly, from 4.4 per cent in autumn-spring 2015-16 to 4.5 per cent in autumn-spring 2016-17.</p>

<p>The percentage of pupils who are, or may become, persistent absentees also rose this year – from 10.3 per cent in autumn and spring 2015-16 to 10.4 per cent in autumn-spring 2016-17.</p>

<p>Illness remains the most common reason for absence, accounting for 60.1 per cent of all absences. </p>

<p>Robert Smedley, who was also pro-vice-chancellor at the university and sat on the board of governors, was convicted of five counts of fraud. His partner Christopher Joynson – who also worked at Edge Hill as a partnership development officer – was convicted on four counts.</p>

<p>They spent the money on home improvements, including a ""luxury kitchen"", police said today.</p>

<p>During the trial, Liverpool Crown Court heard how Smedley gave a job to his partner and then approved invoices for consultancy work from Joynson over a period of five years, which amounted to £513,894.</p>

<p>The offences took place between September 2009 and June 2014 – the year Smedley left the university. The couple had denied the charges.</p>

<h2>Fraud funded 'luxury kitchen'</h2>

<p>Detective Constable David Wainwright, from Lancashire’s Economic Crime Unit, said: “I am pleased that the jury have seen through Smedley and Joynson’s lies and found them guilty.</p>

<p>“Smedley was a member of senior management and abused that position for personal gain. He deceived the university, in particular colleagues he had known for many years, and employed Joynson, his lover, in a position that he had simply devised himself.</p>

<p>“Joynson invoiced the university for hours and hours of work that he had not undertaken, sharing the money with Smedley. They used the cash towards expensive home improvements, including a luxury kitchen.</p>

<p>“The financial impact on the university – the innocent victim in all this – cannot be underestimated; between the pair of them, they managed to defraud Edge Hill of over half a million pounds.“</p>

<p>However, the University and College Union's general secretary, Sally Hunt, said the case raised serious questions. She said: ""This case highlights serious questions that the senior management of Edge Hill University have to answer over governance – something UCU has raised in the past.</p>

<p>""Any attempt by the university to portray itself as the victim in this case would be wholly inappropriate. The real victims are taxpayers, students and staff, and the whole sorry episode brutally exposes how a lack of transparency in universities can leave them vulnerable to fraud.""</p>

<p>Edge Hill University has declined to comment until the pair have been sentenced.</p>

<p>Coding was <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/there-more-new-computing-curriculum-just-coding"">added to the national curriculum</a> in 2014, and is expected to be taught to children from the age of 5.</p>

<p>However, a poll of 500 teachers in the state and independent sector, conducted by YouGov for IT consultancy BJSS, found that 67 per cent of teachers throughout Britain feel they cannot effectively teach coding to children aged between 8 and 15 as they do not have the right skills or tools.</p>

<p>Some 83 per cent of teachers thought it was important for the Department for Education to provide better training.</p>

<p>It also found that 39 per cent of teachers said they do not have access to adequate IT and software to teach coding.</p>

<p>Glynn Robinson, managing director of BJSS, said: “To safeguard the UK’s digital competitiveness, it is crucial that primary and secondary school teachers are properly equipped and resourced to teach the digital and coding skills that will be required by the time today’s schoolchildren enter the workforce.”</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the DfE said: “Coding is an important life skill and forms an important element of the computing curriculum and we want to make sure that all teachers should have the knowledge and confidence to teach it effectively.</p>

<p>“Since 2012, the department has pledged £5 million to the Network of Teaching Excellence in Computer Science programme run by Computing at School, which has built a national network of nearly 400 specialists Master Teachers schools can commission to provide bespoke training for their teachers”</p>

<p>He added that a further £1 million had been given to Computing at School to create free online resources for primary school teachers who lack the specialist computer science subject knowledge required to teach the new curriculum.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a separate YouGov survey for Sam Labs revealed how much importance parents attach to coding.</p>

<p>The poll of 2,102 adults in the UK found that 52 per cent of primary and secondary parents agreed that basic coding should be taught before children leave secondary school.</p>

<p>And 38 per cent of primary, and 39 per cent of secondary parents, thought coding was more important than art.</p>

<p>It also found that 70 per cent of 18-to-24-year-olds wished they had received coding lessons while they were at school.</p>

<p>Here are some of the things we learned:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Academies reported a half a billion surplus for 2015-16 </strong>– The sector reported an operating surplus of £534 million for the year up to 31 August 2016.<br />
	<br />
	At the end of the year, 2,819 trusts had cumulative surpluses, with a total cumulative surplus of £2.287 billion. But 165 academy trusts finished the year with a cumulative deficit. Their total deficit was £50m, with an average shortfall per trust of £306,000.<br />
	 </li>
	<li><strong>The academy system continues to grow</strong> – The number of schools operating as academies increased by 14 per cent between 31 July 2015 and 31 July 2016. At 31 July 2016, 27 per cent of state-funded schools were academies. In the secondary sector, the proportion was much higher, with 66 per cent of schools having academy status.<br />
	 </li>
	<li><strong>Most academies are in a multi-academy trust</strong> – There were 3,636 (63 per cent) academies, free schools, studio schools and university technical colleges in a trust with more than one academy, forming 763 MATs. The number of schools in a trust with only one academy was 2,137. The average number of academies in a MAT was five.<br />
	 </li>
	<li><strong>Converters perform better than local authority schools, which perform better than sponsored academies </strong>– At key stage 2, the percentage of pupils meeting the expected standard in reading, writing and maths was 57 per cent in converter academies, 54 per cent in local authority maintained schools, and 44 per cent in sponsored academies.<br />
	<br />
	Similarly, at secondary level, 64.4 per cent of pupils in converter academies achieved five or more A*-to-C GCSEs, including English and maths, in 2016. For maintained schools, it was 56.4 per cent and for sponsored schools it was 47.2 per cent.<br />
	<br />
	The report says these differences are not unsurprising. “On the one hand, the results for 2016 showed that attainment in ‘converters’ remains above the national average in both primary and secondary schools,” it says. “This is to be expected, given that only good and outstanding schools can ‘convert’. <br />
	<br />
	""On the other hand, 2016 results for 'sponsored' academies are below the national average. This is also to be expected given that schools are ‘sponsored’ when they are underperforming.”<br />
	 </li>
	<li><strong>Academies were defrauded by almost £1m – </strong>According to the report, the value of reported fraud committed against academy trusts was £989,237, with trusts recovering £605,615. At the same time, trusts reported £190,000 of fraud against the Education and Skills Funding Agency, but no money was recovered.</li>

<p>But <em>Dynasty</em> actor Stephanie Beacham plays a new role in a tongue-in-cheek video for the public sector union Unison.</p>

<p>The video starts with a teaching assistant not being able to buy food because ""her pay has barely risen in seven years"".</p>

<p>But ""Official Spokesman"" Ms Beacham is on hand to promote a new initiative for TAs and other public sector employees feeling the pinch. </p>

<p>""The government is introducing a brand new scheme to show you how much we all care,"" she says. ""Introducing, Pats on the Back!""</p>

<div class=""media_embed"" height=""315px"" width=""560px""><iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315px"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/nvsonNNrMJc"" width=""560px""></iframe></div>

<p>She goes on to extoll the virtues of the initiative: ""Pats on the back help workplace morale, make you feel all warm inside, plus they're just as good as receiving fair pay!"" (Immediately afterwards a high-speed disclaimer informs us: ""Please note, pats on the back are not as good as receiving fair pay."")</p>

<p>Commenting on the video, Ms Beacham said: “I wanted to do this film because I find it deeply unacceptable that public service staff who keep us safe, look after us when we’re ill and keep our local services running haven’t seen a pay rise in seven years.</p>

<p>“Our public service workers deserve more than a measly pat on the back, they need substantially more money in their pockets. The public sector pay cap has to go now, and be replaced with a decent wage.""</p>

<p>Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said: “Giving public service workers a pat on the back isn’t going to put food on their table, petrol in their cars or pay their bills.</p>

<p>“Government ministers have been quick to praise public servants, but slow to appreciate the financial strain their harsh pay policies are putting on households up and down the country.</p>

<p>“In the Budget, the chancellor needs to dig deep and give public service staff a pay rise that more than matches the rising cost of living.”</p>

<p>A leadership development charity, Ambition School Leadership, commissioned the Education Policy Institute to look for links between the characteristics of MATs and their outcomes.</p>

<p>The EPI looked at the size, school phases, school types, pupil characteristics, geographical spread and rate of growth at 402 MATs. This is just more than half the total number of MATs, according to <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/654811/Academy_Schools_Sector_in_England_Consolidated_Annual_Report_and_Account....pdf"">recent figures.</a></p>

<p>It looked at how well MATs performed in five areas: pupil progress at key stages 2 and 4, improvement in value-added over time, outcomes for disadvantaged pupils, whether schools are rated “inadequate”, and financial sustainability.</p>

<h2>Unique MATs</h2>

<p>The research identified 19 trusts that were high performing in one or more of these areas, including four trusts that demonstrated high-performance across three of the areas.</p>

<p>The four trusts were Outwood Grange, Harris Federation, Ark Schools and the Diocese of Westminster Academy Trust.</p>

<p>A further nine trusts demonstrated high performance in two of the three areas:<em> </em>The Kemnal Academies Trust, the First Federation, Oasis, AET, The Priory Federation of Academies, St Barnabas Catholic Academy Trust, South Nottingham Academy Trust, Aspirations Academies Trust and Inspiration Trust.</p>

<p>The research found that “no one structural feature was consistently linked to sustainable growth”. </p>

<p>And there was no clear relationship between pupil progress at KS2 or KS4 and the geographical isolation of schools.</p>

<h2>'Mixed evidence'</h2>

<p>But the researchers did note that “none of the 19 high-performing trusts have schools with high levels of isolation”, meaning none had schools that were further than an hour from any other school in their trust.</p>

<p>They also found that there was “some evidence that trusts with a mix of phases are more likely to show improvements in performance at KS2 and KS4 than those working in a single phase”. However, the analysis was unable to explain why this might be.</p>

<p>There was “mixed evidence” about the <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/minister-tells-small-mats-team-grow"">connection between growth and performance</a>. Trusts that had grown more rapidly were more likely to show improvements at KS2, which the researchers said could reflect them taking on schools requiring improvement.</p>

<p>However, their current KS2 performance was mixed, with rapidly growing trusts more likely to be above average on writing progress but below average for reading.</p>

<h2>Three-phase programme</h2>

<p>James Toop, chief executive of Ambition School Leadership, said the research showed ""there is no unique formula for creating a high performing multi-academy trust.”<br />
<br />
The report is the first in a three-phase research programme, with parts two and three due for release next year.</p>

<p>Mr Toop said Ambition School Leadership would next be “testing the hypothesis that the most important thing for creating a sustainable MAT is the coherence between the organisation’s vision, strategy and operating model”.</p>

<p>Commenting on the research, Nick Brook, deputy general secretary of the NAHT headteachers’ union, said: “One size does not fit all for schools and neither will it for MATs.</p>

<p>“The research reaches the inescapable conclusion that leadership matters. Relationships matter. Local understanding matters.”</p>

"366219","How to help the parent-teacher juggling act","/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/how-help-parent-teacher-juggling-act","The government has said that it wants schools to offer more flexible working conditions. But to ride out the recruitment crisis, leaders need to go further than just offering part-time contracts, argues Katie White","<p>Parenting and teaching have a lot in common. Both require energy, organisation and a commitment to late nights and early starts. Both are high-reward, but high-maintenance. The question is: given how much it takes to teach and to parent, how on earth can one be good at both concurrently?</p>

<p>I find that being a secondary school English teacher and the mother of a two-year-old is often very challenging. I feel guilty if I miss school to look after my daughter when she is ill or when my childcare falls through at the last minute. And I feel guilty if I miss seeing my daughter when I have to stay late for parents’ evenings or school trips, or just when the marking has overwhelmed me and I am reading The Gruffalo on autopilot while actually thinking (worrying) about the stack of exercise books waiting for me.</p>

<p>The solution, of course, lies with department heads and school leaders, who have the power to assist working parents to manage the never-ending juggling act between teaching and parenting. But what strategies should schools be using to provide support?</p>

<p>Here are four simple things that can make a big difference:</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>1. Ensure a slow start</h2>

<p>It was really important to build up my workload slowly after returning to work from my maternity leave. One of the most helpful things that schools can do is to not expect new parents to be working at full speed – as they were before they were parents – by the end of day one.</p>

<p>Offering “keeping in touch” (KIT) days while a member of staff is still away on parental leave will give them the chance to get organised before diving in at the deep end. And once the member of staff returns, let them build up slowly to taking on any extracurricular activities or duties outside of the classroom.</p>

<h2>2. Implement a sharing system</h2>

<p>Leaders should ensure that resource development is being shared across departments to lighten the planning load – something that will support all members of staff, not just those who are parents.</p>

<h2>3. Give more time</h2>

<p>School leaders will also have to accept that things will take a bit longer for returning parents. I now leave school straight away at the end of the day (when possible) so that I can get a few quality hours in with my young daughter before she goes to bed. I eat dinner and only then switch back into teaching mode at around 9pm. I still get everything done, but it is definitely not as fast a turnaround as it used to be.</p>

<h2>4. Don’t underestimate ambition</h2>

<p>It is equally important that schools don’t undervalue teacher-parents either. Leaders need to remember that just because someone might not be visible in school, that doesn’t mean that they are not working and not wanting to progress.</p>

<p>So don’t shy away from giving them opportunities to develop and to take on new responsibilities once they have had a chance to readjust. This year, for example, I have mentored two PGCE students. Being given this responsibility was a real boost to my confidence, and made me still feel valued, despite the change in my personal circumstances.</p>

<p>When offering teacher-parents opportunities to develop, bear in mind that the school might need to allow some flexibility with hours, to help them meet the challenges of childcare.</p>

<p>My school has been incredibly supportive and non-judgemental when I have been late or needed cover at the very last minute because of factors out of my control. This, again, makes me feel supported and valued and, as a result, even more committed to my job.</p>

<p>Sometimes something as simple as your head of department asking, “What can school do to help you?”, even if the answer is “nothing”, can make all the difference.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Overall, what I have found is that the more flexible school is with me, the more that I give back. I go out of my way to be the best I can because I know that when I am in need of support, the school will give that to me without question or judgement.</p>

<p>Retaining good staff is always going to be the most successful economic model for schools and, in the current climate, this is more important than ever. With just a tiny bit of extra support, schools can help teacher-parents to be brilliant in both of their roles – and hold on to their best teachers in the process.</p>

<div>in the UK economy.</div>

<div>In a keynote speech, the Labour leader will say the education system is in a ""perilous state"" while the prospect of a ""bad"" Brexit deal threatens to exacerbate existing weaknesses in the economy.</div>

<div>Addressing the Association of Colleges Annual Conference in Birmingham, he will urge chancellor Philip Hammond to use the Budget on 22 November to announce new investment in infrastructure, technology and training.</div>

<h2><strong>'Damaging failure of austerity'</strong></h2>

<div>With the Office for Budget Responsibility expected to downgrade its forecasts for economic growth due to continuing poor productivity, Mr Corbyn will say ministers can no longer ignore the scale of the crisis.</div>

<div>""To get a measure of the extent of this crisis, consider the fact that in mid-2017 productivity levels were lower than they were a decade ago, despite the huge</div>

<div>technological advance of the last ten years,"" he will say.</div>

<div>""It's a truly astonishing statistic which underlines the damaging failure of austerity. With increased automation in the workplace, we need to be offering more opportunities than ever before for people to take on the jobs of the future.</div>

<div>""In the 21st century the economies that succeed are those that invest, most of all in people.""</div>

<h2><strong>'Damaging record'</strong></h2>

<div>The Labour leader will say Mr Hammond needs to re-set government policy to protect the economy from the possible fall-out from Brexit.</div>

<div>""A bad Brexit deal risks making existing weaknesses in our economy - low investment, low productivity and low pay - even worse,"" he will say.</div>

<div>""Brexit should instead give us the impetus to tackle our productivity crisis, which is making our country poorer.</div>

<div>""The answer lies in investment: in infrastructure, new technologies and people. But instead, the government has cut the schools budget, cut college funding and saddled students with a lifetime of debt.</div>

<div>""Next week's Budget is an opportunity to break with that damaging record - and it must be taken.""</div>

<div>Mr Corbyn will say that Brexit also risks adding to the problems facing the education system which has become heavily reliant on staff from the</div>

<div>EU, with 5,000 teachers from EU countries qualifying to teach in the UK in 2016.</div>

<div>""It's no exaggeration to say that education is in a perilous state: funding has been cut year upon year, the attainment gap is widening and the curriculum has narrowed as courses have been cut,"" he will say.</div>

<div>""We are already suffering from a recruitment crisis in the teaching profession and that will only get worse if the government fails to secure the rights of EU nationals currently living here.""</div>

<p>Ms Spielman, speaking today at <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-news/use-budget-end-damaging-cuts-corbyn-urge-chancellor"">the Association of Colleges’ annual conference</a> in Birmingham, said that several thousands of learners in colleges with Ofsted grades of either <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-news/ofstedwatch-latest-ofsted-reports-fe-and-skills"">""inadequate"" or ""requires improvement""</a> were not getting the level of education they deserve, because senior leaders were either failing to identify the ""early signs of deterioration"", or not doing enough to fix them.</p>

<p>“Too many grade 3 colleges failed to improve quickly enough to become good or outstanding at re-inspection. Taken together, this means that several thousands of students are in colleges where not everybody is getting the level of education and training they deserve,” Ms Spielman said.</p>

<p>“In these colleges, too often we observe senior leaders, including governors, actually, failing to spot the early signs of deterioration of standards or to do enough to rectify them, and teachers who aren’t stretching their students enough,"" she added.</p>

<h2><strong>Funding 'considerably' lower</strong></h2>

<p>Ms Spielman acknowledged that funding was a critical concern for many struggling colleges. “For colleges that are struggling to deliver the best for their students, I do appreciate that the level of challenge and change in the sector has been a factor,"" Ms Spielman said. “I recognise that funding levels are considerably lower than any other part of the education system, and I recently drew to the attention of the [House of Commons] Education Select Committee to this.""</p>

<p>Ms Spielman said that in addition to funding constraints and real term cuts to pay for staff, the government’s reforms to technical education had also created its own unique challenges for colleges. She pledged that Ofsted would revise its methodology for <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-news/pearson-apprenticeship-provision-branded-inadequate-ofsted"">inspecting apprenticeship provision</a> in colleges in order ""to fit the new world of apprenticeships"", with pilot inspections already planned. ""These will make sure that our inspection practice stays focused on the right things,"" she said.</p>

<p>Ms Spielman added that more needed to be done to improve the progression rates of learners going from level 2 qualifications to embarking on an apprenticeship programme, with less than 10 per cent of students doing so.</p>

<p>“Much more needs to be done to encourage these young people to take up apprenticeships,” Ms Spielman said. “We know it can be done. In one college visited for our survey, nearly one in four students was going on to apprenticeships from a level 2 programmes – thanks to the commitment of the college leadership and the design of the curriculum. This is where the apprenticeship reform programme does present real opportunities for you as a sector.""</p>

<p>Speaking to delegates, Ms Spielman also said that, with new providers and employers entering the market due to the apprenticeship levy, she wanted to ""reassure"" colleges that Ofsted would be keeping an eye on them.</p>

<p>""While it is early days in terms of understanding how many new providers are entering the apprenticeship market, I do want to reassure you, our existing and experienced providers, that Ofsted will be monitoring these newcomers closely,"" Ms Spielman said. ""I can announce today that I have asked my inspectors, to do some early monitoring visits to a sample of new providers over the coming months. This will allow us to evaluate how well prepared these providers are.”</p>

<p>“With <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-news/learndirect-has-resources-exist-foreseeable-future"">the recent experience of Learndirect</a> fresh in all of our minds, I have no doubt all of you are acutely aware of the risks faced when large sums of money flow into the system, with insufficient quality control.""</p>

"367032","Exclusive: Academisation in jeopardy due to excessive pay, warns Sir Michael Wilshaw","/news/school-news/breaking-news/exclusive-academisation-jeopardy-due-excessive-pay-warns-sir-michael","A quarter of the best paid academy bosses, who earn more than £150,000 a year, have received double-digit pay rises","<p>England’s top-paying academy trusts have approved pay rises of up to 141 per cent, with many academy leaders who run a single school now paid more than the prime minister, according to a Tes analysis.</p>

<p>About one in four (24 per cent) of the country’s best-paid academy bosses enjoyed double-digit pay rises in 2015-16. Almost half of those enjoying inflation-busting increases ran trusts comprised of a single school.</p>

<p>The findings have prompted <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/sir-michael-wilshaw"">Sir Michael Wilshaw</a>, former Ofsted chief inspector and a strong supporter of <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/multi-academy-trust"">academies</a>, to warn that the academy movement is in danger of being derailed due to “reputational damage”. He said: “The Department for Education has clearly lost control. Public money is not being spent well and the excesses that we’re seeing in relation to salaries will bring down the whole programme unless the DfE gets a grip.""</p>

<p>Tes examined the annual accounts of the 121 academy trusts named by the DfE as paying at least one employee in excess of £150,000 a year in 2015-16. The academy leaders in our analysis earned £179,000 a year on average in 2015-16 – 19 per cent more than the prime minister’s salary.</p>

<p>The figure has risen sharply since 2014-15, when it was £161,000. The pay increases have been condemned by shadow education secretary Angela Rayner as evidence of a “fragmented, unaccountable school system in which there is too little meaningful oversight of how millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money is spent”.</p>

<h2>Rising pay</h2>

<p>The rises in remuneration for academy bosses are in stark contrast to the restrictions placed on teachers, who have endured a 1 per cent pay cap – effectively a pay cut – for seven years. Clive Neathey, chief executive of the Rosedale Hewens Academy Trust, which runs seven schools, received the biggest percentage increase. He saw his pay soar to between £205,000 and £210,000 in 2015-16 – up by 141 per cent on the previous year.</p>

<p>Beverley Amos, the chair of trustees at the trust, claimed the figures are “misleading” and said: “Mr Neathey had previously made a decision, in the interests of the trust, to effectively take a significant pay cut at a time when the trust was expanding by commissioning a number of new provisions.""</p>

<p>In 2014-15, in a year when the trust took on an extra school, Mr Neathey was paid £85,000-£90,000. This was down on the previous year, when the academy chain had six schools and paid Mr Neathey £110,000 to £115,000. The year before that, in 2012-13, the trust took on three new schools and he was paid £180,000-£185,000.</p>

<p>Another trust in the DfE’s list of top payers was St Helen’s Catholic Junior School in Brentwood, Essex, which has about 350 pupils. In 2015-16, its headteacher, Bozena Laraway, was paid between £150,000 and £160,000 – a 50 per cent rise on the previous year, which she says reflects the consultancy support she gave to another school during that time.</p>

<p>Although Sir Dan Moynihan, chief executive of the Harris Federation, tops the list in terms of his actual salary, which was £420,000 in 2015-16, it rose by a comparatively small 6 per cent that year.</p>

<h2>Increased pension contributions</h2>

<p>The Tes analysis also reveals that more than one in three of the top-paying academies in England have increased the amount they pay into the pension pots of their biggest earners. Eighty trusts included data on pension contributions in their accounts. Of these, 61 per cent gave pension rises of up to 100 per cent to their highest-paid individuals.</p>

<p>When combined with salaries, pension contributions resulted in two-thirds of England’s top-earning academy bosses receiving benefits of almost £200,000 a year on average.</p>

<p>Sir Dan Moynihan had the largest pension contributions, valued at between £50,000 and £55,000 in 2015-16 – up by 25 per cent on the previous year. But the biggest percentage rise – 100 per cent - was received by Denise Shepherd, then chief executive of the Thinking Schools Academy Trust. This was enhanced due to a £85,833 severance payment.</p>

<p>When questioning whether large increases can be justified, the same rules apply to pension contributions as to salaries, according to Matthew Wolton, a partner at law firm Knights 1759, who specialises in academies. Under these circumstances, he says, any increase “should follow a robust evidence-based process and be reflective of the individual’s role and responsibilities”.</p>

<p>The government has created a system “that encouraged a culture of paying headteachers and school leaders what they want, and teachers what you can get away with” claimed Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT teaching union.</p>

<h2>Government under scrutiny</h2>

<p>Responding to the concerns over excessive pay, a DfE spokesperson said: “It is essential that we have the best people to lead our schools if we are to raise standards."" They added that levels of executive pay should “follow a robust evidence-based process” and be “reflective of the individual’s role and responsibilities”.</p>

<p>National schools commissioner Sir David Carter and academies minister Lord Agnew will face questions over executive pay at an evidence session being held by the Education Select Committee next month. Committee chair Robert Halfon said: “The Department for Education should strengthen its financial oversight of academy schools and MATs, which in the past has not been proactive enough.""</p>

<p>Academy trustees take on the main responsibility for overseeing leaders’ salaries, basing their decisions on the Education and Skills Funding Agency’s (ESFA) <em>Academies Financial Handbook</em>. But the guidance needs to be strengthened, as there is “no consistency to pay levels, in terms of the number of pupils being educated or performance of the schools”,  according to Emma Knights, chief executive of the National Governance Association. She said: “Despite our requests over a number of years, there is still no official guidance on setting executive pay for larger academy trusts and federations.""</p>

And I agree that the academy system needs to self-administer an urgent fix.</p>

<h2><strong>The importance of good governance</strong></h2>

<p>The failure of Wakefield City Academies Trust is first and foremost a failure of governance. The biggest challenge that the emerging multi-academy trust sector faces is to understand that governance of a large and complex organisation, which is its own legal entity, is significantly different from other forms of school governance.</p>

<p>The governing bodies of local authority-maintained schools do not have the same legal and financial responsibilities of a single academy or multi-academy trust (MAT) board. In addition to the duties of a school governor, the directors of academy and multi-academy trusts are directors under company law and trustees under charity law. They are also the employer and the holder of land titles.</p>

<p>The level of responsibility is, therefore, significantly greater, and the requirement for board to have the skills to lead the organisation is correspondingly greater.</p>

<p>In relation MATs, directors are governing a <em>complex</em> organisation with multiple schools. The level of knowledge, skill and experience is, therefore, greater even than the requirements on a single academy trust.</p>

<h2><strong>Why don’t we simply return to local authorities?</strong></h2>

<p>So, you might ask, why not just return the whole thing to local authorities? That system was, at least, easy to understand. The answer is that it is both <em>undesirable </em>and <em>impractical</em>. And I say this as a previous chief education officer in two local education authorities.</p>

<p>It is undesirable because local authorities previously held (and still hold for schools they maintain) a number of conflicted roles. They are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>The employer</strong>: local authorities are the direct employers of all staff in community and voluntary controlled schools;</li>
	<li><strong>The improver</strong>: local authorities, through their improvement services, act as the improver of schools in their locality; and</li>
	<li><strong>The intervener</strong>: since 1996, local authorities have had powers of intervention in schools they maintain.<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, if a local authority-maintained school is causing concern, the local authority can direct its school improvement service into the school. Who, in this scenario, should be held to account if the school fails to improve? The headteacher? The governing board? The local authority? As the employer, the maintained school is not a separate legal entity from the local authority. Therefore, the local authority is technically intervening in itself. And this is before we bring local politics into the mix.</p>

<p>Perhaps most importantly, it is also <em>impractical</em> to return to local authorities. Fiscal policy has removed the capability and capacity of local authorities in relation to schools.</p>

<p>As I’ve <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/does-local-government-have-a-future-education"">written previously for Tes</a>, I believe in local government. But local government does not ""maintain"" GP surgeries or health services. Democratic accountability for health outcomes is exercised more strategically. The same could be true for education and educational outcomes. We just need a sensible grown-up conversation about this.</p>

<h2><strong>In defence of multi-academy trusts</strong></h2>

<p>MATs, unlike local authorities, are created as purely educational organisations. They exist to improve educational outcomes for children and young people in the communities they serve. They have no other function – just that sole purpose. And the most successful MATs are doing the most extraordinary things.</p>

<p>I believe it is desirable to have organisations responsible for schools and their improvement <em>whose sole purpose is education</em>. Albeit with some key differences, Ontario, one of the highest-performing education jurisdictions, organises its schools in groups called school boards. The boards are the employer of staff and directly responsible for improvement. They exist purely as educational entities. They are not part of the municipal authority.</p>

<p>The MAT is not a panacea for all things good or bad. <em>It is simply a legal vehicle</em>. It provides the legal basis for schools to group together in strong and sustainable structures: a system in which groups of schools work collectively in deep collaboration to improve outcomes for pupils.</p>

<p>And, to be clear, the legal basis of the MAT is a charitable organisation. The sole object is to advance education <em>for the public benefit</em>. The income and property of the trust must be applied solely towards its objects – to advance education for the public benefit.</p>

<p>There is no private benefit here. Schools are not ""owned"" by a profit-making business. They are part of a charitable organisation whose sole focus is education for the public benefit.</p>

<p>The system is not perfect. There is much about it that needs our attention. And there <em>are</em> too many controversies, the most recent of which is the Wakefield City Academies Trust. I am certainly not defending the chronic and unacceptable failures of this trust. It failed the children and communities it served. But I do want change to come from within the system itself.</p>

<p>The MAT could be the single biggest positive intervention in our education system. It could achieve change at scale and transform educational outcomes in local areas. Yes, it is a structural intervention – but unlike any other structural intervention, the best MATs are using the power of the group of schools to bring about rapid and fundamental change, based on powerful models of school improvement, deep collaboration and professional learning across the group.</p>

<p>We need to know more about how the most successful MATs are improving outcomes for children and also closing gaps for the most disadvantaged. We need to be much more intellectually curious about this. My challenge to the academic community is to help us to do this. And my challenge to the sector is to step up.</p>

<p>Former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan said: “There is no trust more sacred than the one the world holds with children."" Let’s build our system of multi-academy trusts on this principle – the ethical principle that first and foremost, we are holding trust with, and on behalf of, children. </p>

"367485","The ‘double whammy’ gives children the wrong message","/news/school-news/breaking-views/double-whammy-gives-children-wrong-message","Parents and teachers must work together to combat bad behaviour – but that doesn’t mean disciplining twice for the same offence, says Jarlath O’Brien","<p>Working in true partnership with parents to improve the behaviour of their child in school has been one of the most rewarding parts of my job over the years. I still have, however, one particularly painful memory of a time when a parent and I, despite our best efforts, couldn’t see eye-to-eye.</p>

<p>One Friday morning, a father brought his son in and asked to see me. We were due to have a school trip that day and he wanted Lenny to remain at school because he had behaved poorly at home. “I can’t have him rewarded for what he did last night,” said the father. “He needs to be punished.”</p>

<p>I disagreed. I tried to explain that we felt very strongly that things that happen at home should be dealt with at home, while things that happen at school should be dealt with at school. We’d be delighted to support him to help Lenny improve his behaviour at home, but punishing at school wasn’t an effective way of doing that. Besides, the trip was a curriculum entitlement, so he would be going.</p>

<p>Regrettably, I couldn’t persuade the father to see my way of thinking, and I know he left feeling unsupported.</p>

<h2>Doubling up the sanctions</h2>

<p>It was unusual, because this conversation usually happens the other way around. A child commits a misdemeanour at school and the temptation is to sanction at home, too. Sometimes this suggestion comes from the school in an attempt to work together to solve a problem. I have always vehemently disagreed with the double whammy of being punished at home a second time for something that happened at school.</p>

<p>I’ve lost count of the times a child has had something like their Xbox removed from their room in response to an incident at school. This is a behaviourist tactic and follows the logic that increasing the discomfort in some general way for a child will force them into improving their behaviour. The fact that the device and its location have nothing to do with the incident at school is neither here nor there.</p>

<p>“That’ll teach ’em a lesson,” always has me thinking: “What lesson are we teaching them, exactly?”</p>

<p>Asking parents to support us in our drive to improve behaviour is crucial. Keeping them informed about how things are progressing, meeting regularly and, if needed, talking through behaviour reports at the end of each day are all smart. Sending good news home when things get better is an easy win.</p>

<p>Above all, you want to send a strong message to the child that school and home are on the same side. The child needs to know, though, that that is their side; doubling up on sanctions patently fails to ensure that.</p>

<p>Teachers say they are expected to group children in order to prepare them for the phonics check taken at the end of Year 1 and the KS1 Sats taken at the end of Year 2, a study by the UCL Institute of Education has found.</p>

<p>The study, commissioned by the National Education Union (NEU), discovered that, while 45 per cent of teachers think grouping damages some children’s self-esteem, it is seen as a “necessary evil” due to the pressure that schools are under from the statutory tests.</p>

<p>“The findings make for challenging reading,” Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the NEU, said.</p>

<p>“It’s an absolute disgrace that the pressure on schools to ensure pupils pass tests means children as young as three consider themselves ‘low ability’ right at the start of their academic life, a belief that could impact on their self-esteem, carry on throughout their schooling and determine the direction of their adult lives.</p>

<p>“The National Education Union will work hard to lobby the government to address accountability and curriculum pressures that lead to the labelling of children. As a first step to improving the situation, the government should commit to make the phonics screening check non-statutory.”</p>

<p>The research has been commissioned as the government prepares to reintroduce a<a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/dfe-planning-spend-ps10m-reception-baseline-test""> Reception baseline assessment</a>, which could mean teachers having to test children at the beginning of Reception in literacy, maths, communication and possibly ""self-regulation"".</p>

<p>“There is a real risk that if bring in an assessment at the beginning of Reception that encourages further labelling of children,” said the UCL Institute of Education's Alice Bradbury, one of the co-authors of the report.</p>

<h2>Limiting expectations?</h2>

<p>More than 1,400 teachers were involved in the study, including 1,373 who responded to a survey and the others in four focus groups and four case study schools.</p>

<p>The survey found that across nursery, Reception and key stage 1 teachers most commonly grouped children in phonics classes (76 per cent), then maths (62 per cent), reading (57 per cent) and literacy (54 per cent).</p>

<p>Even in nursery classes, more than half (58 per cent) of children were grouped for phonics sessions.</p>

<p>The survey found that 52 per cent of teacher felt grouping did improve results. But there were also fears that it could reduce children’s confidence and limit their expectations.</p>

<p>""It was deemed an efficient way to plan differentiated lessons but it made children very competitive and destroyed self-esteem in some pupils,"" one teacher told the researchers.</p>

<p>Beatrice Merrick, chief executive of early years association Early Education, said: ""Many, including parents, will be shocked by the pervasiveness of setting, streaming and other 'ability' based interventions with children aged 3 and 4, and even more so given the evidence that shows this harms far more children than it helps.</p>

<p>“It is worrying that so many teachers feel pressured into such steps against their better judgement; we hope this will lead to dialogue in all schools about how best to ensure all children achieve their potential without fear of early labelling or artificial constraints on their learning.""</p>

<p>Minister for Children and Families, Robert Goodwill, said: “Teachers and early years staff are best placed to make decisions about the teaching methods they use. There is no statutory requirement that suggests children should be grouped by ability.</p>

<p>“We are clear that, while assessment is a fundamental part of children’s education to measure progress, it should not cause significant stress or anxiety.”</p>

","<p>Justine Greening has called for more “industry experts” to become college teachers to deliver <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-news/first-t-levels-subjects-announced"">T levels</a>.</p>

<p>Speaking at the Skills Summit at the Department for Education today, the education secretary called for a “new alliance” between business and education to form a “deep, strategic, mutually beneficial partnership”.</p>

<p>“This is a government that believes in business – we see you as the solution,” Ms Greening told employers at this morning’s event.</p>

<p>“I’d also like to see more industry experts actually going into colleges and teaching,” she added. “What more credible voice is there for a young person in a college that a person who is part of the industry they are interested in?”</p>

<h2><strong>'Culture change'</strong></h2>

<p>A “culture change” in businesses was needed to deliver young people with the skills they require, Ms Greening told the audience.</p>

<p>“This is about a culture change for business, a mindset shift. And if we really are going to have a skills revolution in our country, it cannot be business as usual.</p>

<p>“This is about providing <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-news/many-apprentices-treading-water-warns-sutton-trust"">high-quality apprenticeships</a>. This is about providing <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-news/t-levels-work-placements-requirements-published"">high-quality work placements</a>. Only business and employers can really deliver that for young people.</p>

<p>“We all talk to them and they are crying out for these opportunities. But the reality is that not enough businesses are, at present, offering them. I want young people to see business as the solution to get the education and opportunities they want. I believe that business can be a broader force for good in our country.”</p>

<p>She added: “Britain has got talent and it’s spread evenly across the country - the problem is that opportunity isn’t.”</p>

<p>Ms Greening said that the three-month work placements built into T levels were a “vital” component of the programme, and called on employers to make them a success.</p>

<h2><strong>Aligned to local economy</strong></h2>

<p>When asked by <em>Tes </em>after the event about concerns raised in the sector about how young people in rural areas may not have access to the same work experience opportunities as their peers in cities, Ms Greening insisted that there should be “a universal offer on opportunity” – but that provision should be aligned to the local economy.</p>

<p>“I think that’s important, that young people know wherever they are growing up, there’s a consistency of what they can access in terms of technical education.</p>

<p>“At the same time, we need to make sure we <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-views/uk-paying-its-low-emphasis-skills"">knit together FE colleges and local employers</a> much more closely, so that when you’re training in your local college you are training in a T level in a skill that… your local economy will need as well.”</p>

<p>When asked if she could envisage handwritten exams still being used in 10 years, Janet Brown told <em>Tes Scotland</em>: “I think that would be very unusual…I would be surprised if we still had handwritten exams.”</p>

<p>Electronic assessment was already used for some courses, said Dr Brown, of the Scottish Qualifications Authority, adding that “society’s going that way”.</p>

<p>However, before an entire education system moved in that direction, she said, “you need to make sure…no one’s disadvantaged” – adding that “the day is not tomorrow that we’ll move away from paper”.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, <em>Tes</em> columnist Nancy Gedge wrote that research showed there were many <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/i-am-a-mission-save-handwriting-schools-whos-me"">good reasons to teach handwriting</a>. She said it was “one of those fundamental background skills that provide support for all sorts of other learning”.</p>

<p>Education systems around the world have taken different stances on cursive, or joined-up, handwriting.</p>

<p>In 2015, it was widely reported that <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/if-we-deny-pupils-handwriting-we-are-robbing-them-a-form"">Finnish schools were phasing it out </a>in favour of keyboard skills, although the Finnish government said that the issue was <a href=""http://www.oph.fi/english/current_issues/101/0/writing_by_hand_will_still_be_taught_in_finnish_schools"">not quite so clear-cut</a>.</p>

<p>This year, an education bill in the US state of Indiana sought to <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/sticking-script-leaves-me-scratching-my-head"">make cursive writing a requirement</a> in elementary (primary) schools.</p>

But when she bumps up against questions about what she takes for granted, then she has the opportunity to occupy a wider universe.</p>

<p>Here are four books that prompt children to enquire deeper and tease the edges of her world out a little further.</p>

<h3><strong>1. <em>The Black Book of Colours</em> by Menena Cottin and Rosana Faria</strong></h3>

<p>What would colour mean to you if you couldn’t see? Could you feel yellow from the sun on your skin? Would green appear to you with the smell of cut grass? Is white in the sound of seagulls as they fly over the beach? With its embossed black drawings on black paper, I’ve never known a child who hasn’t wanted to brush their finger over this book’s mysterious pages. Touch, sight, smell and taste; our senses become bleached with everyday use, that is until you’ve read T<em>he Black Book of Colours</em>.</p>

<h3><strong>2. <em>It Might be an Apple</em> by Shinsuke Yoshitake</strong></h3>

<p>To see a world in a grain of sand and a curled up fish in a red apple… Well, that’s not exactly what Shakespeare said, but what if an apple might not be an apple but be a ball or a post box or an apple you peel only to find more peel inside? If you eat it then it might turn you into a giant, or turn to rubber in your mouth. The apple might start to eat you. Yoshitake rejoices in the move from “is” to “might”, from how a child’s world must be to what could be.  </p>

<h3><strong>3. <em>This is not a Book</em> by Jean Jullien </strong></h3>

<p>When is a book not a book? Does it have to have words inside or are pictures enough? Do the pictures have to follow on from one another or can it still be a book if it's random? Does a book have to be about something? If there are pages, a spine and a front and back cover, does that mean it must be a book? Is the front door of your house like the front cover of a book? What I love about showing this book/non-book to children is that its lack of text allows me to be silent as I present each page to them and so it gives me the chance to watch their faces as their minds brim with questions. </p>

<h3><strong>4. <em>The Big Ugly Monster and the Little Stone Rabbit</em> by Chris Wormell</strong></h3>

<p>A monster is so hideous that in his company the trees shed their leaves and the grass turns brown. Even the stones smash when he smiles at them. All but one that is. One that he has carved into the shape of a rabbit. The monster and the rabbit become friends. On the barren land, they sing, dance and lark. Then, after a death in the story comes the blossoming of spring, catching the reader off guard. I sometimes ask children, “If a librarian was putting happy books in one pile and sad books on another, where would this one go?” They frequently go back and forth in their answer. For children, there is often no simple take away from the book other than the desire to read it again. A story they can’t quite touch the edges of, this always gets them reaching further.</p>

"370011","‘Extreme anger’ over library cuts","/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/extreme-anger-over-library-cuts","Plans emerge two months after promise of protection","<p>A council is planning to axe all school librarians and another is proposing to halve the number in secondary schools – only two months after campaigners hailed a landmark policy that promised unprecedented protection for school libraries.</p>

<p>The Scottish School Library Alliance said it was “extremely angry and disappointed” about the plans, while well-known authors have warned that such cuts will lead to falls in attainment and literacy.</p>

<p>The moves also call into question how much the Scottish government’s support for a service counts when councils are desperate to find ways to balance their books.</p>

<p>The proposed cuts appear in public consultations on budget plans in South Ayrshire and Moray councils. South Ayrshire proposes removing all school librarians and school library assistants – a spokesman said there were currently three librarians and seven assistants – as part of broader plans to save nearly £2 million over two years by reducing school support staff.</p>

<p>Moray’s plans would result in four secondary school librarians being reduced to two, as part of an attempt to cut £378,000 over two years from schools’ devolved budgets.</p>

<p>The announcement on 28 September that Scotland would have the UK’s first national school libraries strategy, enshrining minimum standards, was greeted enthusiastically by Save Scotland’s School Libraries campaigners, who had fought against cuts for six years. The Scottish government also announced £1 million funding to improve school libraries over three years.</p>

<p>After hearing news of the South Ayrshire and Moray proposals, however, a spokesman for the Scottish School Library Alliance said: “We are extremely angry and disappointed that two local councils have put forward proposals that are completely out of step with the national strategy for school libraries, which was launched by cabinet secretary for education John Swinney only two months ago.”</p>

<p>He added that, at the strategy’s launch, Mr Swinney described school libraries as playing “a vital role in supporting literacy and improving attainment”. The spokesman said the South Ayrshire and Moray proposals would have “an enormous impact on young people who have no say in how these decisions are made”.</p>

<p>James Robertson, the Scottish novelist best known for <em>The Testament of Gideon Mack</em>, has worked with many schools and was “dismayed” by the proposals.</p>

<p>“If this is about saving money, then I have to ask, how much and to what purpose, if the net effect is to damage young people’s education?” he said. “If it is solely about money, then the cabinet secretary for education needs to discuss, urgently, with all councils how to prevent such cuts going ahead – indeed, how to increase levels of library service provision in all our schools.”</p>

<p>Mr Robertson added that once such library posts have gone, “it is very unlikely that they will be brought back”.</p>

<h2>‘Literacy at risk’</h2>

<p>Matthew Fitt, a teacher and author whose Scots language translation of <em>Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</em> was published last month, said: “Cuts in the school library service today will result in cuts in literacy rates and attainment tomorrow. Pupils whose parents can afford to buy books will suffer less. Those pupils whose way into reading is through their school library will, as usual, suffer all the more.”</p>

<p>David Barnett, president of School Leaders Scotland, is headteacher at Elgin Academy in Moray, whose librarian, Sheilagh Noonan, was on the final shortlist of three for this year’s UK and Ireland School Librarian of the Year award. “A good librarian can add a huge amount to a school – and can really assist in improving literacy and promoting a love of reading. The knock-on that can have across the school is immense,” he said.</p>

<p>Mr Barnett described Elgin Academy’s library as “the beating heart of the school – there’s always something happening there”. Not having a librarian, or only having one for half a week, would have “a significant impact” on young pupils, he said, adding that school libraries had a “direct impact” on attainment.</p>

<p>A Scottish government spokesman said: “As our National Libraries Strategy underlines, school libraries play a vital role in developing literacy, supporting attainment and encouraging people of all ages to develop and maintain a love of reading.”</p>

<p>He added: “It is the responsibility of local authorities to determine the requirements for their school libraries, including the recruitment and deployment of school library staff, taking into account local needs.”</p>

<p>The spokesman also said that, as part of the strategy, every child in Scotland will receive a library membership.</p>

<p>South Ayrshire Council chief executive Eileen Howat said it had to plug a £17 million funding gap in 2018-19 and that it was “getting harder and harder to balance the amount of money we have to spend against the money we need to deliver council services”.</p>

<p>Last month, <em>Tes</em> reported on a campaign in England to save school libraries, backed by big literary names such as Philip Pullman, Francesca Simon and Malorie Blackman (“Top children’s authors demand Justine Greening step in to save school libraries”, 23 November). In a letter to education secretary Justine Greening, the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals (CILIP) said England should follow the Scottish government’s example in seeking to use school libraries to improve educational outcomes.</p>

<p>I recently wrote this blog about <a href=""https://headteachersroundtable.wordpress.com/2017/12/01/whats-our-biggest-blind-spot-in-education-by-sam-twiselton-samtwiselton/"">one of the biggest blind spots in education</a>.</p>

<p>My response to <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/teacher-training-last-extra-year-under-strengthened-qts-proposals"">today's consultation document on QTS reform</a> brings many of these thoughts back to mind, and I feel so much more optimistic now. It's brilliant to see that the importance of the early career phase is recognised. However, it is vital that this is framed in a way that is about support and development – not compliance and hoop-jumping. The way the consultation is presented is very promising in this respect. This matters as it's only this way that we can get anywhere near to solving the teacher recruitment and retention crisis that is (in my view) the number one priority right now. In saying this, I put the emphasis as much, if not more, on retention as recruitment. This is potentially where support and development in the early career phase could make a real difference.</p>

<p>Apart from the obvious reasons why teacher retention matters, there are other crucial factors that may not be quite so familiar:</p>

<p><strong>Teacher recruitment problems and high teacher turnover impact by far the most on schools with the poorest intakes</strong>. Schools with affluent intakes have double the percentage of teachers with more than 10 years of experience, compared with the poorest. Pupils in schools serving areas of higher deprivation are much more likely to have teachers without an academic degree in a relevant subject. The schools serving more disadvantaged communities experience higher levels of teacher turnover and much more dependence on supply teachers, unqualified teachers, fixed-term contracts and NQTs. I could go on. The problem is not experienced evenly across the sector. Those who are impacted most by teacher recruitment and retention problems are the schools with the most deprived intakes.</p>

<p>High numbers of different teachers will always result in highly disrupted learning and relationships. High-turnover schools need to keep recruiting novice, inexperienced teachers. Teachers get better in the first 10 years of their career – these schools are not benefiting from these incremental improvements. Most turnover is also wastage out of the profession – teacher-training costs a lot more than it should as more and more teachers need to be trained to replace those that leave.</p>

<p><strong>This problem is harming schools and government budgets, but, importantly, it is doing the most harm to the most deprived pupils who need the best support.</strong></p>

<p>Just why is this problem so acute? Obviously there are multiple reasons, and I could write at length about workload, accountability, esteem, pay and conditions, lack of agency, but instead I'm going to talk about one of the biggest problems that sits behind a lot of this. It's something everyone knows about but no one in power is really prepared to admit it in such a way that something serious is done about it.</p>

<p><strong>ITE is not long enough, and this means too much is expected of NQTs, which is what makes so many of them leave so early in their careers. </strong>This is the most significant but <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/new-teachers-need-better-behaviour-management-training-says-review"">most underreported finding in the Carter Review</a>. Arguably we were as bad as everyone else. It was underemphasised in the report because we knew nothing would be done about it. The truth is, the initial preparation isn't anything like long enough and, therefore, it's not good enough to meet the very high expectations of heads who employ NQTs. If we collated all the things that all the experts and headteachers, etc, we spoke to said that someone needs to know and be able to do when they start their teaching career, it would probably add up to about five years to cover even in a fairly superficial way. There wouldn't be a single thing you'd take out and, arguably, there wouldn't be a single thing that some NQT somewhere hasn't experienced as a high priority need in that first year.</p>

<h2>'We set them up to feel like failures'</h2>

<p>Thinktank LKMco's <em><a href=""https://www.lkmco.org/why-teach/"">Why Teach?</a></em> report showed that two of the top three reasons why teachers stay in teaching are “being good at it” and “being well qualified to do it”. This was cited by over 90 per cent of respondents and over half said that these three factors were ""very important"". Yet we put so little time into equipping teachers to feel this way at the beginning of their careers. Instead, we set them up to feel like failures. The report also stated that the availability of CPD would influence three-quarters of 25-34-year-old teachers’ decisions about where to work. ITE is not long enough and not enough happens with teachers in the early years of their career to address this problem. This is why early career teachers are crying out for good CPD. Across Europe, the minimum total duration of ITE is usually between four and six years. In Finland,it takes five, in Shanghai between two and four years. The ITE consecutive model lasts seven years in Luxembourg.</p>

<p>The reform of QTS offers an opportunity to do something really significant: guaranteed, visible, sustained and very high-quality support, development and requirements for teachers to go on developing in the first three years after the initial preparation phase. This is the period when support is most needed but, just as importantly, it's the period when it can made most meaningful and when the most significant development can happen.</p>

<p>My organisation, the Sheffield Institute of Education, is trying to do something about this in the Sheffield city region with a new programme called Partnerships for Attainment. This project is about promoting, securing and developing a high-quality teacher workforce. Its success will ultimately be measured by improved student outcomes resulting from consistently high-quality teaching. We’ve been really encouraged by the enthusiasm and commitment shown by our partners to make this initiative work.</p>

"370989","Teachers are ‘becoming a bit weary of change’","/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/teachers-are-becoming-a-bit-weary-change","The fast pace of reform risks fatigue, says new School Leaders Scotland president","<p>If schools don’t have enough money and teachers, all bets are off when it comes to educational improvement. David Barnett is too measured a character to put it in quite such blunt terms. But the new School Leaders Scotland president peppers conversation with reminders of the stark realities facing teachers.</p>

<p>Speaking at the recent SLS annual gathering at Loch Lomond, he warned that local authorities were now so squeezed that education could no longer rely on the special protection it had often been afforded.</p>

<p>It is a warning he repeats when talking to <em>Tes Scotland</em>. “If some of the forecasts prove to be as bad as they are at the moment, we’re going to see ourselves in a position where the quality of the curriculum…could be directly affected by cuts that will have to be made to staffing numbers.”</p>

<p>Barnett has seen warning signs that local authorities will no longer protect education from the worst ravages of budget cuts; this “will inevitably lead to there being fewer teachers employed in schools and therefore less subject choice for young people”.</p>

<p>An inevitable knock-on effect, he says, is that it would become harder to close the attainment gap – an issue upon which the government has staked its reputation.</p>

<p>The biggest town in Moray, Elgin, accounting for about a quarter of the authority’s population, should be experiencing less severe recruitment problems than rural areas, says Barnett.</p>

<p>But last month the council warned that a “grave” shortage of teachers might result in primary pupils attending school part-time; and Elgin Academy is not immune either, having been unable to fill a modern languages post despite four rounds of advertising.</p>

<p>Recruitment difficulties are one reason why Barnett can see potential positives in the government’s controversial “regional improvement collaboratives” – if they lead to support for subject teachers from specialist advisers like those who once worked across the sprawling old regions of Scotland. “That would be a very welcome development,” he says.</p>

<p>More generally, in these tough financial times, Barnett sees a strong argument for forging links across council boundaries. “We have schools and local authorities who are actually quite close geographically, but never really get the chance to work together. Anything that improves those kind of options has to be welcomed,” he says.</p>

<p>Barnett cautions, however, that “there are a lot of unknowns about how it’s all going to work”, adding: “We don’t want it to be another layer of accountability…There is already enough accountability for heads at the moment.”</p>

<p>He is also in two minds about the “massive issue” of the headteachers’ charter that promises to devolve unprecedented amounts of power and responsibility to school leaders. Barnett sees the “key test” being whether heads “become leaders of learning even more so than they currently are”.</p>

<p>He thinks there should ideally be a business manager in every school, to ensure that heads do not instead become bogged down in “the bureaucracy of managing budgets and so on”.</p>

<p>“It’s really important that there are staff there who can do that type of work to allow headteachers and deputes the freedom to be much more involved in directing learning and teaching…rather than spending time looking at spreadsheets and juggling figures,” he says.</p>

<p>A teacher since 1991 and a head for more than a decade, thinking back on his career now, Barnett can recall no precedent for the challenges currently facing the profession. “I don’t think people can remember a pace of change quite like it,” he says. “There is a danger that the profession is becoming a bit weary of change.”</p>

<h2>‘Grave’ staffing shortfall</h2>

<p>But some change in the past 27 years has been for the better, he adds, with schools now far more inclusive and no longer fixated on the success of academic high-fliers to the detriment of others.</p>

<p>“The range and type of support for young people – and our awareness of their needs – has improved hugely,” says Barnett, but with a caveat: “We hope that potential budget cuts aren’t going to affect that too much.”</p>

<p>Despite the gloom gathering around schools as they struggle for staff and resources, Barnett still believes teaching is “the best job in the world” and that more should be done to talk up the profession.</p>

<p>“It’s a huge privilege to be able to influence and guide young people,” he says. “When you see that little lightbulb moment, when you see a pupil that’s struggled to understand something and, through your help, the penny suddenly drops – that’s a hugely rewarding moment for any teacher.”</p>

<p>And, on a lighter note, teaching also provides rewards – and a swagbag of great stories – during moments when the lightbulb hasn’t quite sparked into action. Barnett has one such example from a recent school trip: “We were on a train from Birmingham Airport to the city centre when one of the pupils said to me, ‘Mr Barnett, it’s pitch black out there’ – and I had to reply, ‘Jamie, that’s because we’re in a tunnel.’”</p>

"370998","Could the next education secretary be Nick Gibb? ","/news/school-news/breaking-views/could-next-education-secretary-be-nick-gibb","Please don't panic. In truth, the minister of state for school standards could prove to be the stability candidate ","<p>As <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/six-reasons-teachers-want-justine-greening-stay"">speculation continues about whether Justine Greening will be kept on as education secretary</a> in a forthcoming cabinet reshuffle, gossip is rife about who might replace her.</p>

<p>One persistent rumour is that comeback king<a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/nick-gibb""> </a><a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/nick-gibb"">Nick Gibb</a>, currently minister of state for school standards, might be elevated by Theresa May to the largest office in Sanctuary Buildings.</p>

<p>On first visitation, this idea does seem slightly unlikely: this was the politician who as schools minister was fired by the coalition government before making an improbable comeback to more or less the same job less than two years later.</p>

<p>It is also the kind of idea that would send teachers who identify with the progressive wing of education’s false-dichotomy emigrating to the four winds. He is, after all, the unofficial godfather of the neo-trad movement.</p>

<h2>Upping the ante</h2>

<p>But bear me out, firstly, on why this idea isn’t as unlikely as it first seems – and secondly on why the king of harder Sats, phonic checks and times tables tests might not be such a bad idea for schools.</p>

<p>Firstly, it has been well-briefed that there are those in the Conservative Party's ranks who think that Ms Greening needs replacing because she has apparently gone soft on <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/michael-gove-leaves-department-education-major-cabinet-reshuffle"">the education's “blob”</a>: the collective Govian noun for teacher training establishments, the unions and the teaching profession in general. She is, it would seem, failing to uphold the Govian legacy.</p>

<p>Mr Gibb would be a willing volunteer when it came to upping the ante when it comes to – verbally, at least – taking on <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2298146/I-refuse-surrender-Marxist-teachers-hell-bent-destroying-schools-Education-Secretary-berates-new-enemies-promise-opposing-plans.html"">Mr Gove's ""enemies of promise""</a>. He has demonstrated little of Ms Greening’s enthusiasm for the college of teaching and <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/nick-gibb-can-say-crisis-what-crisis-much-he-wants-we-do-have-a"">still refuses to recognise that there is a crisis in teacher recruitment and retention</a>. He has few friends in the teacher unions and Govian rhetoric would not be a problem for him here.</p>

<p>In addition, it is believed that No 10 is keen to promote a political line about improvements in school standards – and there’s even talk of a major prime-ministerial speech on the subject. This is totally Mr Gibb’s schtick – look at his job title – and even more so since last month when he has <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/reading-results-should-ring-ears-opponents-phonics-says-gibb"">basked in the glory of his phonics check being credited with pushing UK schools up the Pirls international literacy rankings</a>.</p>

<h2>Stability candidate</h2>

<p>Supporters of Mr Gibb’s elevation – and there are many more within the Conservative Party than there would have been a year or two ago – say he could be the stability candidate with extra oomph.</p>

<p>But for all the political oomph in the world, the appointment of Mr Gibb would be unlikely to be headline-grabbing or politically sexy on a national stage.</p>

<p>So Mr Gibb’s destiny lies in the scale and style of Ms May’s ambition for this reshuffle. If she is plotting the wholesale relaunch of her administration, there’s every chance we’ll be looking at a new, young gun parachuted into the Department for Education. Likely a red-meat Brexiteer – in contrast to Ms Greening’s consensual Remainer style – you’d expect political battles to be manufactured where there are none and a whole raft of new policies promoted where few are needed.</p>

<h2>Nick Gibb's main mission</h2>

<p>Contrast this with what you would expect from Mr Gibb. The veteran education minister knows his patch from top to bottom and believes totally and utterly in the righteousness of the curriculum and exam reforms that he and Mr Gove have rammed home since they came to power in 2010. He makes no secret that his main mission is to ensure that these are allowed to bed in and become hard to unravel.</p>

<p>Schools might not have universally loved these reforms when they were proposed (UNDERSTATEMENT KLAXON), but most would much rather deal with what they’ve now got – at least for a period – than start over again.</p>

<p>If Ms May were to promote Mr Gibb there would, of course, be harder language about demanding higher standards. He’d likely attack the classroom unions in a speech or two and he would certainly ensure that the times-tables tests become an established part of life in primary schools. But in practice, he would more than likely represent stability – albeit with a little extra combative language.</p>

<p>Better the devil you know.</p>

"371070","Bursting the bubble of parents ‘bursting with pride’","/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/bursting-bubble-parents-bursting-pride","","<p>The end of last term was predominantly about Christmas performances. Between school and my own kids, I reckon I notched up a record number of viewings in a week.</p>

<p>Being fairly new to the parent side of the school nativity, two things struck me: the first is how awful a view you get when the school hall is packed with seated adults watching small children on a two-foot-high stage, and the second is the parents’ reaction to the production.</p>

<p>As a teacher it’s always nice when a parent stops you to say they liked the performance or compliments you on the singing, but I have discovered some parents take these things to extreme lengths when it comes to their own children.</p>

<p>“Bursting with pride,” gushed one mum on social media. “Couldn’t be any prouder of this total superstar,” said another next to a photo of a dazed-looking penguin. While I agree it’s natural to feel pride in your children’s achievements, I did wonder if this overwhelming sense of delight was quite in proportion to the achievement itself. Her child had been put into a costume, sung a couple of action songs and done a little wiggly dance on stage. Like many of the others around him, he looked both happy and bemused, and generally unaware that he was in a performance at all. If this had her fit to burst with pride, I did worry about how she might cope if he ever won a Nobel Prize.</p>

<p>Maybe I’m just a hard-hearted mother who doesn’t cherish my children’s efforts, but Mr Brighouse and I agreed that our overwhelming emotion at watching our youngest child’s school nativity was hilarity, coupled with a deep and compassionate admiration for the teachers.</p>

<h2>Something earned</h2>

<p>I’m all for praise and encouragement, but surely these are best reserved for when something is earned, lest hyperinflation render it as valueless as Damian Green’s Number 10 security pass.</p>

<p>Of course, when it comes to your own kids, any achievement, however small, can fill you with a sense of wonder (and, in my case, relief that maybe they won’t turn out to be psychopaths after all). But as teachers know well, for every child achieving against a background of a stable, happy home life, there is one who is doing it against the odds.</p>

<p>These are the pupils most likely to make us proud. The children who enter the classroom unsupported and unstable, who are battling all sorts of problems in their home lives, yet still make great strides. When these children achieve; when they work hard; when they make even an inch of progress, there is a palpable sense of pride among the adults who work with them.</p>

<p>Where we sometimes forget to direct the praise is at those who create the conditions to make this possible: every teacher, head, teaching assistant, dinner lady, governor and Sendco who has been instrumental in helping and supporting that child.</p>

<p>Teachers, by nature, move quickly to regret. We focus on what we failed to do rather than what we did. But I have still never taught anywhere where I couldn’t identify a child whose life had been immeasurably improved by the persistent support and encouragement of the adults at school – and that’s definitely something to be proud of. Let’s not forget this as we move from seasonal bonhomie into the season of depressing New Year’s resolutions.</p>

","<p>So she’s gone. After a leviathan power struggle inside No 10 this evening, Justine Greening’s short reign as education secretary is over.</p>

<p>And whatever else happens now, her widely predicted departure appears to mean one crucial thing for the nation’s schools – Number 10 wants to be back in charge of education.</p>

<p>We know this because prime minister Theresa May is <a href=""https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/theresa-may-ready-to-replace-top-cabinet-ministers-in-reshuffle-38s88vsvq"">reported</a> to want improved schools standards to be a major theme of a new year Conservatives’ relaunch. And with a new education secretary only just getting their feet under the table at Sanctuary Buildings, it seems likely that the imperative for whatever change is being planned will not come from within the DfE but from Downing Street itself. Education ministers will just have to work out the details.</p>

<p>Of course, this is hardly new territory. Recent education history is littered with instances where the PM and their advisers have sought to take over the rudder of our schools system.</p>

<p>At the turn of the century, it was Andrew Adonis who was acting as Downing Street’s in-house alternative education secretary and last year it was Nick Timothy. From Blair’s trust schools to the recent aborted attempts at forced 100 per cent academisation and the opening of new grammar schools, the results are often ineffective.</p>

<p>Whether you regard Downing Street meddling in our schools system as a good thing largely depends on whether you want the actual education secretary of the day to be left unencumbered to introduce the policies they believe in.</p>

<p>Michael Gove had one of the freest hands as David Cameron allowed him to proceed at high speed with policies like free schools that had played well in the right-wing media long before his government was elected.</p>

<p>Some will undoubtedly wish a few more obstacles were thrown in Mr Gove’s way. But others grow increasingly wistful about what they see as a golden era of school reform.</p>

<h2>Stay of execution</h2>

<p>Justine Greening was forced to operate at the other end of the spectrum. Almost as soon as she started, it was clear that Downing Street was hellbent on opening more grammar schools – a policy that not only went against the thinking of almost everyone in education but also the views of Greening herself.</p>

<p>May’s general election disaster had appeared to have saved Ms Greening, allowing to her ride out pre-vote sacking rumours and stay on at the DfE to proceed with a more consensual approach.</p>

<p>However, it only turned out to be a stay of execution. The PM’s view of Greening as <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/patronising-justine-greening-fights-her-job"">“patronising”</a> is reported to have been one reason for her downfall; as has her reported claims that she has been <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/the-waugh-zone-monday-january-8-2017_uk_5a53342be4b0efe47eba2233?utm_hp_ref=uk-the-waugh-zone"">“less than supportive</a>” of her leader.</p>

<p>But policy could also have been an issue. Some<a href=""https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5168344/why-is-education-chief-justine-greening-so-immobile-on-social-mobility/""> have interpreted criticism from Mr Timothy</a> – May’s former key adviser and architect of the grammar schools plan – in December as a sign that Greening’s time was up.</p>

<p>Whatever the case, it leaves her successor facing a baptism of fire. Anything cooked up for a school standards relaunch will either have to be a product of the Number 10 ideas factory or something that the new secretary of state will have to be put together in a matter of weeks.</p>

<p>Either way, it is likely to be a difficult sell to the education world. It will also have to be radical sounding enough to make headlines – almost always the key requirement when Downing Street is involved – need little or no extra money and not require any legislation that would have to proceed through a delicately hung Parliament.</p>

<p>Above all, it will have to keep the prime minister happy. The new education secretary’s first task will not be an easy one. </p>

"371703","Alternative provision shouldn’t stop at 16 – adults need help, too","/news/further-education/tes-magazine/alternative-provision-shouldnt-stop-16-adults-need-help-too","Continued support – and individualised study programmes with a vocationally geared curriculum – result in more success stories, writes Lisa Capper","<p>Alternative provision remains under the spotlight. In 2016, Ofsted published a report on this area after a three-year survey. More recently, the Commons Education Select Committee has made alternative provision a key focus area. The recent Making the Difference report from the Institute for Public Policy Research (bit.ly/DifferenceReport) suggests that 99 per cent of the 48,000 young people who leave AP each year do so without gaining five good GCSEs.</p>

<p>While it is refreshing to hear more is being done to quality assure alternative provision, it is clear that underperformance continues. The IPPR has set out an ambitious framework to address this issue in schools.</p>

<p>But the issue does not stop at the age of 16. Around 50 per cent of those who attend alternative provision become Neet (not in education, employment or training) in the six months after they leave. Issues such as family breakdown, offending or poor mental health remain unresolved. Some young people in this situation cannot successfully enrol onto college courses and often find larger institutions daunting. If they find work, too often this is only on temporary or zero-hour contracts and can lead to debt, homelessness or worse.</p>

<p>At social justice charity Nacro, we have extensive knowledge and experience of working with disadvantaged young people. Many of the young people who attend one of our education and skills centres experience multiple barriers, have had breaks in their schooling or have not been able to complete their school career, and very often have previously attended alternative provision.</p>

<p>Nacro delivers individualised study programmes with a vocationally geared curriculum to around 3,000 students each year aged 16-18, and a smaller number of 14- to 16-year-olds in partnership with local schools, having achieved zero Neets in the past year. All students follow a personal development plan so that barriers to progression are identified and acted upon. Specialist interventions are sought, and time is spent tracking down education records and carrying out assessments, before any student is introduced to vocational study that is linked to a potential job or career pathway.</p>

<p>Technical programmes are taught by experienced staff, often from industry, looking for ways to “give back”; and two-thirds of our students achieved positive progression last year. It is sometimes a bumpy road, but behaviour standards often set by the students, meaningful rewards and positive relationships make a big difference in the interactions and attendance that we see, compared to those reported at predecessor schools.</p>

<p>We have seen first-hand that introduction to work is often a successful way of re-engaging students at post-16 stage, but we need more employers to come forward and support first and second-chance placements. In the North East, Nacro has engaged university students who act as ambassadors with employers.</p>

<p>We have seen many success stories. Jez had been out of statutory schooling for three years before finding Nacro. He left with level 2 functional skills in maths and English and is now an apprentice bricklayer. Anu, who had suffered organised abuse, learned how to manage her pregnancy and care for her newborn baby through our specialist programme for young women and achieved her level 2 functional skills in maths at the same time.</p>

<p>Nacro prides itself on never giving up. We work with young people in the community and in secure settings, where it feels the system is rigid and where others sometimes struggle to meet complex individual need. We know that staff training and making the most of “what works” for each student is key.</p>

<p>Transformational learning through alternative provision is not just an issue for schools. Young people are not able to “shrug off” the issues that have held them back once they hit 16. They need continued support through an extended framework in post-16 education. This could provide a vital lifeline and a very different future for many more young people.</p>

"372024","Triple marking, book scrutiny, lesson observations – the many misguided attempts to make learning visible","/news/school-news/breaking-views/triple-marking-book-scrutiny-lesson-observations-many-misguided","In her fortnightly column, Daisy Christodoulou asks whether we can find a solution to the issue of making learning and teaching visible","<p>Assessing and measuring what goes on in the classroom is an attempt to make learning visible. Most of the time, the way we do this is to get pupils to produce some kind of work. We can’t see what is in their head, so we get them to try and represent their understanding either by writing something, drawing something, solving a problem, or ticking a box.</p>

<p>What matters is not what they write or draw, but whether we can use what they’ve produced to work out whether they have understood something or not.</p>

<p>If assessment questions are ambiguous or badly-designed, pupils who do have the right mental understanding can still get the question wrong.</p>

<h2>Assessment problems</h2>

<p>My favourite example of such a question is this one.</p>

<p><em>Put these words in alphabetical order: take, value, use.</em></p>

<p>The ""right"" answer is: take, use, value. That’s the order you’d find these words in a dictionary.</p>

<p>But what about the pupil who writes: aekt, aeluv, esu?</p>

<p>This pupil has put these words in alphabetical order, just not in the way the examiner was expecting.</p>

<p>This problem doesn’t just affect pupils. Most of the teacher-accountability systems we see are attempts to make teaching visible: to identify if teachers are causing learning to happen.</p>

<h2>Triple problems</h2>

<p>One way of doing this is to look at the assessment results of pupils. But other methods involve lesson observations and book scrutinies – and with these, too, badly-designed assessments can give us misleading information.</p>

<p>The development of ""triple marking"" is a good example of this problem. Schools started with the evidence-based principle that feedback helps pupils improve.</p>

<p>They then moved to the next stage: what can teachers do to give feedback to pupils – and how can managers and inspectors check they have done so?</p>

<p>Surely, if a teacher has written a comment, a pupil has responded and the teacher has responded to that comment, it’s proof of a feedback loop?</p>

<p>And so triple marking was born, with many negative consequences. It turned what should have been an immediate five-second classroom conversation into a process that took hours. It forced feedback into the straitjacket of a written dialogue, making it harder to use examples, images and quick oral questions.</p>

<h2>Repeated issues</h2>

<p>Triple marking did not, therefore, give us an accurate idea of who was and wasn’t giving quality feedback. Even worse than that, the focus on triple marking probably made teachers less likely to give quality feedback, because they were spending all their time writing comments in books, rather than thinking about ways they could adapt their next lesson based on what they knew about their pupils.</p>

<p>Triple marking crowded out the process it was supposed to measure. Not only did it give us inaccurate information about who was doing the right thing, but it also made it harder for teachers to do the right thing in the first place.</p>

<p>What’s the solution to this problem?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there aren’t any quick fixes. Perhaps one good general piece of advice is to think through the consequences of any new assessment of teachers or pupils. Any assessment will encourage and discourage different types of behaviour, and we should be clear about what those are before we introduce it.</p>

<p>Professor Hargreaves, who is a professor in the Lynch School of Education at the US university, is known for his support for greater autonomy for teachers and concerns about the impact of high-stakes testing.</p>

<p>He has served as an adviser in education to the premier of Ontario and is on Scotland’s International Council of Education Advisers, which recently told the Scottish government that it should <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/pay-more-attention-pedagogy-inspectors-told"">pay more attention to the pedagogy</a> in Scotland’s schools and <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/create-a-culture-encourages-collaboration"">ensure a culture of collaboration</a>.</p>

<p>His books include: <em>The Fourth Way</em>, co-authored with Dennis Shirley, which sets out a way of educational change that integrates government, professionals and community; <em>Teaching in the Knowledge Society</em>, which examines how to prepare young people for a world of creativity and <em>What’s Worth Fighting for in Your School</em>, about how to make collaboration work for change, which was co-authored with Michael Fullan.</p>

<p>“I’m very grateful to Boston College for its enormous support and flexibility, particularly in regard to the university’s faith that my somewhat ‘fuzzy’ initial project proposals would actually become something significant. It’s time, however, to step aside for generational equity, to make space for others,” he says in a statement published on the Boston College website.</p>

It’s the stuff of the futuristic science fiction films that we watched as children. Personally I’d have preferred a hoverboard, but we have AI, it’s revolutionising our lives on an unprecedented scale, and there’s no stopping it.  Slow on the uptake Education has been slow to utilise AI, but in a basic form, it exists in various programs and apps that you might use with your pupils. Most of these programs assess a child’s level in a chosen subject, use this information to set work or questions, and automatically mark the answers.  At the simplest AI level, some of them (Reading Eggs, for example) will not allow a child to unlock the next level until they have demonstrated proficient ability in an end-of-level test.  Other, slightly more advanced, versions (such as Skoolbo) collect and analyse data from pupils’ answers, allowing a teacher to look at the information and identify any gaps in understanding or ability.  For those of us who hate marking (that’ll be everybody, then), this is a time-saving dream come true, of particular use in subjects that require concrete answers, such as maths or phonics.  But what if I told you that this is only the tip of the AI revolution iceberg; that, within 10 years, the majority of learning will be done through artificially intelligent software; and that the career that you trained for will be unrecognisable?  Simon Balderson is assistant headteacher at Wells Cathedral School in Somerset and organiser of AIConf – an international conference dedicated to artificial intelligence in education. He is adamant that these changes will happen and that teachers need to find a way to embrace them or they could find themselves unemployable in the radically different culture of the future.  “What we think of as a teacher’s role is going to evolve,” he explains.  “At the moment, we deliver content and assess pupils but, as AI infiltrates classrooms, this will change. AI is developing so rapidly that, in the future, it will be able to detect, for example, the micro-expressions that pass across someone’s face when they are struggling to understand a concept, and will pick up on that and adapt a lesson to take account of it.”  It will adapt automatically the way a teacher does, but will be able to do this constantly, consistently and for every pupil, he says. “No teacher can do that with 30 children per class. AI will also manage data for each pupil, ensuring that work is always pitched at exactly the right level for every student. Currently, that level of differentiation is impossible.”  If AI is going to assess our pupils, differentiate lessons for them and plan work and activities accordingly, what’s going to be left for us to do? Lesson delivery? Apparently not. “Whereas now each school has subject specialists, in the not-too-distant future, it will be possible for lessons to be delivered by the best teachers and most knowledgeable subject specialists in the world via AI technology,” says Balderson.  “We’ll be doing a far better job for our students: they’ll all have access to the greatest teachers in the world regardless of where they live or their socioeconomic group.”  I put this idea to a fellow teacher, then stood back and awaited the explosion. “If I were one of the best teachers in the world and someone wanted me to deliver lessons to children all over the world via AI, as they thought it would give them the best possible experience, I would struggle to see how that was possible,” says Susannah Jeffries, a primary school teacher from Edinburgh.  “What makes learning memorable is shared experience, shared attention and human interaction.”  Balderson is quick to reassure that teachers will still have a significant role but that our role will be mentors, helping to direct children in their learning rather than delivering lesson content. He also says experiential learning will still play a huge role, especially in EYFS and primary education.  Do I believe all this will actually happen? I’m not sure. But I have concerns if it does. To quote the renowned child psychiatrist James P. Comer, “no significant learning occurs without a significant relationship”.  What about empathy? In my experience, the teachers I learned best from were kind and empathic, taking an interest in their pupils and understanding what made each child tick emotionally as well as academically. How many times have you adjusted your interaction with a child because you knew that their pet rabbit died that morning or that their parents were separating? While AI will be able to monitor a child for signs of emotional distress, an algorithm can’t possibly offer the innately human trait of empathy.  A paper by the National Scientific Council on the Developing Child titled Young Children Develop in an Environment of Relationships (bit.ly/NSCpaper) addresses this need for interaction and empathy in detail. It states: “Children who develop warm, positive relationships with their kindergarten teachers are more excited about learning, more positive about coming to school, more confident and achieve more in the classroom.”  But you can’t develop a warm, positive relationship with a piece of software, however sophisticated it is, surely?  Actually, some of the research work around humanoid robots suggests that it is possible to feel something for a synthetic being (Wall-E, anyone?).  OK, so what about creative thought? Surely AI won’t be able to teach that? “There is ongoing discussion about this,” says Balderson. “We need to decide what makes us uniquely human and is therefore inappropriate to be replicated.”  Optimistic about the changes While Balderson is optimistic about the changes that will take place, stating that it will empower us and our students, I was left questioning the ethics of this and panicking about robot teachers invading our schools and stealing our jobs. I needed some good news, so I spoke to Rose Luckin, professor of learner-centred design at University College London’s Knowledge Lab. Otherwise known as “the Doctor Who of AI”, she’s been developing and writing about artificial intelligence in education for more than 20 years.  So, is my vision of a dystopian future in which children spend every day sitting in rows, engaging only with a screen, correct? Apparently not. “Increased automation and artificial intelligence does not necessarily equate to an increased use of screens,” Luckin reassures me. “Devices such as, Alexa or Google Home are examples of voice interfaces in common use. There is every possibility that there will be a much wider range of interfaces for people to use in order to interact with their computing technology [in the future].”  Will our jobs be safe? So at least we don’t have to worry about churning out a conveyor belt of screen-addicted students. But are our jobs going to be safe in this new world? Luckin sets the record straight. Within 10 years, she says, all educators should have “an AI assistant that takes care of record keeping and marking”.  “AI assistants will be able to conduct detailed analyses of huge sets of data about each pupil so that teachers can provide carefully targeted mentoring to ensure all students fulfil their potential,” she says. They will be able to track each student “as they progress cognitively, metacognitively, physically and emotionally”.  Flexible working OK, I’m sold on AI assistants. No more marking or record keeping? Count me in. But what else is in it for teachers?  “We should also be able to provide the technical infrastructure to enable educators to work in a more flexible manner,” says Luckin. “This kind of technology could support job sharing…and make flexible working practices more accessible to schools.”  This would be a welcome improvement, particularly for parents who work in the profession. But surely, if artificially intelligent software is doing much of our job for us, this could lead to redundancies on a massive scale? Luckin thinks not.  “While I don’t think teachers will be automated out of their jobs, I do think their jobs will change enormously.  “We will need students to leave school with a very different skill set and we will need them to be able to work effectively in jobs that are augmented with artificial intelligence,” she says.  “Therefore, teachers are going to need to be able to educate their students in ways that will give them the skills and abilities.”  Both Luckin and Balderson are keen to impress on me the importance of lifelong learning in the future as people adapt their skills and knowledge to the artificially intelligent world. This need to keep learning means that educators will be in constant demand to help people do this.  So not all bad news for teachers, but it does appear that a radically different job market awaits us. While some of the benefits to staff seem clear, I can’t help wondering about the fall-out as vast numbers of teachers become disillusioned with the prospect of this new working life.  None of us went into teaching for the record keeping, but many of us did so because we love to interact with children and impart knowledge. If that is taken away from us, what’s left of our vocation? And do we have any say in this process anyway?  The more I think about it, the closer I get to asking Alexa to build me a bunker to hide in, ready for when the AI apocalypse hits. Luckin says the biggest challenge will be getting teachers like me not just on side but putting us in control of the AI development, too. “The most important thing for us to do at the moment is to engage educators in deciding how AI is to be used in education,” she says. “They are the most important voice in this debate because they understand how to make education effective.  “At the moment, the large technology companies are dominating discussions, [putting them] in prime position to dominate decisions about how artificially intelligent technologies are integrated [into education].  “I do worry that educators will have so-called ‘solutions’ imposed upon them. If we do not address this issue and my worry becomes a reality, then I may well ask to join you in your bunker – I’ll bring some tinned food and a torch, too!”  I’ll pencil that in for 2027, then. Is it wrong to hope that the bunker will have wi-fi?

I needed some good news, so I spoke to <a href=""https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=RLUCK37""><strong>Rose Luckin</strong></a>, professor of learner-centred design at <a href=""http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/departments-centres/centres/ucl-knowledge-lab"">University College London’s Knowledge Lab</a>. Otherwise known as “the Doctor Who of AI”, she’s been developing and writing about artificial intelligence in education for more than 20 years.</p>

<p>So, is my vision of a dystopian future in which children spend every day sitting in rows, engaging only with a screen, correct?</p>

<p>Apparently not.</p>

<p>“Increased automation and artificial intelligence does not necessarily equate to an increased use of screens,” Luckin reassures me. “Devices such as, Alexa or Google Home are examples of voice interfaces in common use. There is every possibility that there will be a much wider range of interfaces for people to use in order to interact with their computing technology [in the future].”</p>

<p>So at least we don’t have to worry about churning out a conveyor belt of screen-addicted students.</p>

<p>But are our jobs going to be safe in this new world?</p>

<p>Luckin sets the record straight. Within 10 years, she says, all educators should have “an AI assistant that takes care of record keeping and marking”.</p>

<p>“AI assistants will be able to conduct detailed analyses of huge sets of data about each pupil so that teachers can provide carefully targeted mentoring to ensure all students fulfil their potential,” she says. They will be able to track each student “as they progress cognitively, metacognitively, physically and emotionally”.</p>

<h2>Flexible working</h2>

<p>OK, I’m sold on AI assistants. No more marking or record keeping? Count me in. But what else is in it for teachers?</p>

<p>“We should also be able to provide the technical infrastructure to enable educators to work in a more flexible manner,” says Luckin. “This kind of technology could support job sharing…and make flexible working practices more accessible to schools.”</p>

<p>This would be a welcome improvement, particularly for parents who work in the profession. But surely, if artificially intelligent software is doing much of our job for us, this could lead to redundancies on a massive scale?</p>

<p>Luckin thinks not.</p>

<p>“While I don’t think teachers will be automated out of their jobs, I do think their jobs will change enormously.</p>

<p><img alt=""robot teacher"" title=""robot teacher"" height=""422"" width=""750"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" class=""media-element file-default img-responsive"" typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""https://tes.com/sites/default/files/robot-teacher_0.jpg"" /></p>

<p>“We will need students to leave school with a very different skill set and we will need them to be able to work effectively in jobs that are augmented with artificial intelligence,” she says.</p>

<p>“Therefore, teachers are going to need to be able to educate their students in ways that will give them the skills and abilities.”</p>

<p>Both Luckin and Balderson are keen to impress on me the importance of lifelong learning in the future as people adapt their skills and knowledge to the artificially intelligent world. This need to keep learning means that educators will be in constant demand to help people do this.</p>

<h2>A new future</h2>

<p>So not all bad news for teachers, but it does appear that a radically different job market awaits us. While some of the benefits to staff seem clear, I can’t help wondering about the fall-out as vast numbers of teachers become disillusioned with the prospect of this new working life.</p>

<p>None of us went into teaching for the record keeping, but many of us did so because we love to interact with children and impart knowledge. If that is taken away from us, what’s left of our vocation? And do we have any say in this process anyway?</p>

<p>The more I think about it, the closer I get to asking Alexa to build me a bunker to hide in, ready for when the AI apocalypse hits. Luckin says the biggest challenge will be getting teachers like me not just on side but putting us in control of the AI development, too.</p>

<p>“The most important thing for us to do at the moment is to engage educators in deciding how AI is to be used in education,” she says. “They are the most important voice in this debate because they understand how to make education effective.</p>

<p>“At the moment, the large technology companies are dominating discussions, [putting them] in prime position to dominate decisions about how artificially intelligent technologies are integrated [into education].</p>

<p>“I do worry that educators will have so-called ‘solutions’ imposed upon them. If we do not address this issue and my worry becomes a reality, then I may well ask to join you in your bunker – I’ll bring some tinned food and a torch, too!”</p>

<p>I’ll pencil that in for 2027, then. Is it wrong to hope that the bunker will have wi-fi?</p>

<p>Born in Yorkshire in 1935, Sir Cyril was a self-made millionaire who was recruited by Conservative education secretary Kenneth Baker to drive his policy of opening city technology colleges – the forerunners to academies.</p>

<p>He was the founder chairman of the City Technology Colleges Trust in 1987, which subsequently became the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust and later the SSAT.</p>

<p>With a reputation for being outspoken, he advised both the Conservatives and Labour on education policy.</p>

<h2>'Guided our mission'</h2>

<p><a href=""https://www.ssatuk.co.uk/blog/sir-cyril-taylor/"">In a statement on the SSAT's website</a>, Sue Williamson, the current chief executive of the network, said: ""Cyril guided our mission for 20 years with purpose and integrity.</p>

<p>""During that time, he served as an advisor to no less than 10 successive secretaries of state for education on the specialist schools and academies initiative. I’m proud to have worked alongside Cyril – and to have counted him as a supporter of our work at SSAT in more recent years.""</p>

<p>Ms Williamson said Sir Cyril had raised more than £350 million in sponsorship to support schools – and that businesspeople like Lord Harris, the founder of the Harris Federation, had engaged with schools ""because of Cyril's drive and passion"".</p>

<p>She added: ""Along with everyone at SSAT, I’d like to convey my deepest sympathies to Sir Cyril’s family and all those who had the privilege to know and work with him.""</p>

<p>The bursary of £22,866 is equivalent to the salary of a probationer teacher.</p>

<p>The proposal is contained in the bid that recently won the tender to deliver <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/universities-deliver-scotlands-controversial-fast-track-route"">a new fast-track route for “high-quality graduates”</a> in chemistry, physics, home economics, maths and engineering.</p>

<p>However, it has yet to be agreed by the Scottish government and councils, said Dr Morag Redford, head of teacher education at the University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI). Her university last week won the bid to deliver the new course, along with the University of Dundee.</p>

<p>The government's plan to create a new route, which is being introduced in response to <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/scottish-councils-crippled-staff-shortages-demand-control-over"">the teacher shortage</a>, has been controversial due to concerns that it would allow the fast-track teacher training charity <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/teach-first-scotland-divisive-or-inclusive"">Teach First</a> to get a <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/could-a-tartan-teach-first-be-finding-its-feet"">foothold in Scotland</a>.</p>

<p>Teach First is regarded with suspicion north of the border because recruits are given responsibility for classes after an intensive summer school of just six weeks.</p>

<p>However, having seen off Teach First, the universities are now left with the challenge of filling spaces on a new fast-track course in <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/maths-and-english-student-teacher-numbers-fall-well-short-targets"">secondary subjects that are notoriously difficult to recruit to</a>.</p>

<p>The aim will be to recruit between 20 and 50 students. The course gets underway in December and will be open in its first year to student teachers looking to work in Aberdeenshire, Argyll and Bute, Highland and the Borders.</p>

<h2>'Optimism' about attracting recruits</h2>

<p>Dr Redford said she was “reasonably optimistic” about filling places, due to UHI’s success to date in training secondary science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem) teachers.</p>

<p>The university started running a one-year postgraduate secondary teacher education course in 2016-17 with seven Stem teachers, and is seeking funding to train 30 in the coming academic year. UHI already has almost 70 applications for places, Redford said.</p>

<p>The new fast-track is being supported by £250,000 of funding from the Scottish government’s Attainment Scotland Fund – money aimed at closing the attainment gap between advantaged and disadvantaged pupils.</p>

<p>The student teachers will be placed in two schools during the course of their studies, both of which will serve disadvantaged areas.</p>

<p>The students will start the course in December and are expected to emerge 18 months later as fully fledged teachers, having served their probation.</p>

"373746","Where has all the money gone?","/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/where-has-all-money-gone","The government insists that schools have never had it so good in terms of funding, yet headteachers up and down the country are being forced to cut jobs and subjects. Charlotte Santry investigates why, despite a real influx of cash, schools are now struggling to balance the books","<p>Imagine working in a schools system that had seen its annual budget grow by nearly £10 billion over 12 years.</p>

<p>And in which per-pupil spending had more than doubled in primaries and nearly doubled in secondaries – in real terms, after inflation – in just 20 years.</p>

<p>This might sound fanciful in England, where schools are becoming used to rounds of redundancies and curriculum cuts.</p>

<p>But this is, in fact, the reality here today. The same schools that are frantically tightening their belts and laying off staff have also experienced a prolonged continuous funding boom, lasting nearly two decades.</p>

<p>Granted, school spending per pupil was cut in real terms by 4 per cent from 2015 to 2017, and is being frozen between 2017 and 2019. </p>

<p>But an analysis of national statistics by the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies clearly shows that, today, schools are still much better off than they were in 1997. Between then and now, per-pupil budgets have risen by 82 per cent on average in secondaries and by 106 per cent in primaries – in real terms.</p>

<p>This week, the new education secretary, Damian Hinds, prompted howls of outrage from teachers in the grip of the current funding squeeze when he said schools have “more money than ever before in the history of the country”. But he was not far from the truth.</p>

<p>And yet, today schools are being completely honest when they say they have nothing left in their budgets and are at “breaking point”. John Tomsett, headteacher of Huntington School in York, sums up the anger felt by many of his peers: “In this fifth or sixth biggest economy in the world, you’ve still got schools that have rain coming through the ceiling.”</p>

<p><img height=""844"" width=""1500"" class=""media-element file-default img-responsive"" typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""https://tes.com/sites/default/files/tes020218_10_inline.jpg"" alt="""" /></p>

<p> </p>

<p>So where has all the money gone?</p>

<p>“This is the most important question in education policy today,” says a former Treasury official who worked for the government in the 2000s, a period during which schools benefited from year-on-year 5 per cent funding increases.</p>

<p>In 2001, the average secondary pupil attracted £4,095 a year in 2015-16 prices. By 2016, this had grown to £6,127.</p>

<p>And while the 2001 funding may look paltry by today’s standards, back then schools thought they were in a time of plenty. “At the turn of the century, everyone [in schools] was doing cartwheels about how much money they had,” the former official says. It was so much more than schools were used to after years of stagnant funding.</p>

<p>But the ex-Treasury mandarin argues that a lot of this extra money was wasted on short-term political whims that have failed the test of time. “Stupid amounts of money were thrown out of the door very quickly, on a very sketchy evidence base, to placate political and policy wheezes that in retrospect were nonsense,” he says. He reels off a list of expensive “gimmicks”, including schemes encouraging personalised learning and others targeting children’s social and emotional skills. </p>

<p>While such initiatives originated in Whitehall, the funding for them formed a growing component of individual schools’ budgets.</p>

<p>Somewhat controversially, teaching assistants are included on the former official’s list of investments offering poor value for money. </p>

<p>Staffing costs clearly made up the biggest chunk of extra school spending in the 1990s and 2000s. According to the IFS, a “small, but notable” portion – around 20 to 30 per cent – of the increased per-pupil expenditure between 1999-2000 and 2012-13 translated into more teachers, paid higher salaries.</p>

<p>An unspecified “substantial proportion” of the cash went on non-staffing such as ICT, energy, professional services and learning resources, according to the IFS. But the largest proportion went on more teaching assistants and other non-teaching staff, which accounted for up to 44 per cent of the increase in primary schools, and up to 38 per cent in secondary schools. Far more was spent on teaching assistants than the government had predicted, and the extent to which this has helped pupils is widely contested.</p>

<p><img height=""1014"" width=""1000"" class=""media-element file-default img-responsive"" typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""https://tes.com/sites/default/files/tes020218_10_stats1.png"" alt="""" /> ​</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Of course, the amount of extra funding overall has varied enormously across the country: primary schools in the most deprived areas enjoyed funding boosts between 1999-00 and 2012-13 of 83 per cent on average, compared with 56 per cent in the least deprived areas. The pattern is even more pronounced for secondary schools, with those in the most deprived areas receiving a 93 per cent increase, against 59 per cent for the least deprived.</p>

<p>But, across the board, the answer to why schools cannot survive on the same funds they had in 2000 is because, according to the former official: “They have a lot, lot, lot more staff on their payroll.”</p>

<p>And that makes trimming budgets when times are leaner a much trickier proposition. Redundancy pay-offs create short-term costs, and many would argue that it is the freezing of teacher salaries in more recent years that has led directly to today’s recruitment crisis.</p>

<p>Even if it were easy to shed some staff in response to a tougher funding settlement, it would not be that simple. Heads and unions point out that behind the increase in staffing is a huge shift in the role that schools are being asked to play, as they are required to take on more and more of society’s responsibilities. </p>

<p>Parents, having grown accustomed to schools offering a range of services, are left aghast when these services are earmarked for cuts. But maintaining them leaves schools vulnerable to the increased costs that come with extra staff, such as pensions, national insurance contributions and unfunded pay rises. </p>

<p>Taken together, these factors can quickly turn a funding increase into a real-terms cut. So, as with the NHS, the actual inflationary costs facing schools are higher than the economic measure of inflation used by the government. This could partly explain why schools are so unimpressed by the government’s pledge to freeze schools’ funding in real terms until 2019-20.</p>

<p><img height=""566"" width=""1000"" class=""media-element file-default img-responsive"" typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""https://tes.com/sites/default/files/tes020218_10_stats2.png"" alt="""" /></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the demands from ministers and the accountability pressures on schools are constantly increasing, at a time when many local authorities no longer provide the same level of support to schools that they once did. And it is widely acknowledged that the costs of educating children with special educational needs and disabilities are increasingly out of kilter with the available funds.</p>

<p>Valentine Mulholland, head of policy at the NAHT heads’ union, says: “Parental expectations for children with SEND or behaviour issues are much, much higher than they were. And that’s not necessarily always a bad thing because actually parents should have high expectations for their children, but it puts a lot of pressure on schools.”</p>

<p>Pressures on SEND budgets are expected to grow, and few would argue that this is an area where cuts could be made. Meanwhile, other support services, like child and adolescent mental health services (Camhs), are being cut, forcing schools to pick up the pieces. </p>

<p>And, in line with the growth of academies, many local authorities can no longer carry out the range of education services they used to for maintained schools. </p>

<p>“We need to be clear that some of the funding being retained by local authorities to deliver human resources, health and safety, premises management…have shifted over to schools – there are really no central services now,” says Mulholland. “Education welfare was a local authority service. There’s now very little support – no support – from local authorities on attendance, and pastoral care.”</p>

<p>Others make the point that schools, rather than wallowing around in excess cash for years, had only just reached a sustainable level of funding before the current pressures kicked in. As Andrew Morris, assistant general secretary of the NEU teaching union, puts it: “The Labour years weren’t the fat years; they were the first time in years when schools were properly resourced.”</p>

<p>Mulholland agrees. “We’re not in a situation where ‘we’ve had it good for a while, now we’re going to have to go back to basics’ – it’s sub-basics for many schools,” she says. “It isn’t cutting off fat, it’s now cutting off flesh.” </p>

<p>Talking to <em><a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/02/04/shakespearegives-children-young-three-confidence-boost-rscs/"">The Sunday Telegraph</a></em>, Ms O’Hanlon said that some schools begin teaching children Shakespeare in nursery. “No age is too young to start learning about the Bard,” she said.</p>

<p>“They are learning new words all the time, every day. Shakespeare is just a new set of really gorgeous, delicious, intriguing words.</p>

<p>“You ignite a curiosity about language. And that is a fantastic skill set, particularly for people from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>

<p>“It narrows the gap. If you go to an independent school what you will be surrounded by is a group of young people who are utterly confident in communication. That confidence and communication is what Shakespeare opens the door to.”</p>

<p>Her comments came after the RSC, commissioned Warwick University to study the effect of studying Shakespeare on children.</p>

<p>The researchers interviewed teachers at around 100 schools where Shakespeare was taught to disadvantaged children and found that 95 per cent of teachers felt it had an impact on children’s confidence – while 84 per cent felt it had boosted spoken and written language.</p>

<p>Ministers said that by 2022, about 50,000 more children will benefit from a free school meal compared to the previous benefits system</p>

<p>The announcement follows a <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/extra-50000-pupils-eligible-free-school-meals-under-universal-credit"">government consultation</a> on eligibility for free school meals, the early years pupil premium and the free early years entitlement for disadvantaged two-year-olds, in light of the national rollout of Universal Credit.</p>

<p>The government said all children currently receiving this additional support will be protected – and these entitlements will be “more targeted in future, to ensure they reach those most in need”.</p>

<h2>Extending free schools meals</h2>

<p>Education minister Nadhim Zahawi said: “It is right that we must continue to offer the most disadvantaged young people additional help and I am pleased that, following public consultations, we can extend free school meals and the free early education entitlement for disadvantaged two-year-olds.</p>

<p>“Tens of thousands more children will be entitled to free school meals by 2022 compared to the previous benefits system.""</p>

<p>This afternoon’s announcement includes:</p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">Introducing a net earnings threshold of £7,400 per annum for free school meals eligibility under Universal Credit, to take effect from 1 April 2018. A typical family earning around £7,400 per annum would, depending on their exact circumstances, have a total household income of between £18,000 and £24,000 once benefits are taken into account</li>
	<li style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">Mirroring these eligibility criteria for the early years pupil premium, which gives additional funding to early years settings to boost the attainment of pupils from low-income families</li>
	<li style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">Introducing a net earnings threshold of £15,400 per annum under Universal Credit for eligibility for the 15-hour free early education entitlement for disadvantaged two-year-olds, to take effect from 1 April 2018</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<p>The DfE said the policy will protect every child in receipt of free school meals at the point at which the threshold is introduced – and every child who gains eligibility before the end of the rollout of Universal Credit, until Universal Credit is fully rolled out.</p>

<p>After this, protected children still in school will continue to receive free school meals until the end of their phase of education. No child who has started their two-year-old early education place will lose it as a result of this new proposal.</p>

"374784","£10,000 'national learning entitlement' proposed for post-18 education","/news/further-education/breaking-news/ps10000-national-learning-entitlement-proposed-post-18","Education experts are proposing a radical new approach to student funding","<p>All school leavers in England should get a £10,000 grant to invest in their education once they turn 18, in a bid to have a fairer <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/funding"">funding </a>system, according to some of Britain’s top educationalists.</p>

<p>A ""National Learning Entitlement"" is being proposed by Tom Schuller, visiting professor at University College London’s Institute of Education; Sir Alan Tuckett, professor of education at the University of Wolverhampton; and Tom Wilson, visiting research fellow at UCL’s Institute of Education.</p>

<p>Details of the new proposal are outlined in a new paper being presented at the IoE tomorrow.</p>

<p>The current system is unfair, inefficient, unaffordable and inflexible, according to the paper, published by the <a href=""http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/departments-centres/centres/centre-for-learning-and-life-chances-in-knowledge-economies-and-societies"">Centre for Learning and Life Chances in Knowledge Economies and Societies</a>, UCL.</p>

<p>It states: “Within any age cohort, university students get all the attention and the lion’s share of financial support. Difficult though it is to get comparable figures, per student funding for university teaching is something like four times the amount given to students in other post-school institutions, mostly further education colleges.""</p>

<p>The paper adds: “Overall the funding for adult skills and education has been cut every year for 10 years, down to £1.5 billion. This leaves a tiny amount per capita for adult learning.""</p>

<h2>Striking a balance</h2>

<p>It argues for a “National Learning Entitlement that would enable free access to publicly provided, or publicly recognised, education and training for the equivalent of two years for all those aged 18 and above”.</p>

<p>This would include adults without degrees, something which would help to reinvigorate adult education and a culture of lifelong learning for all, according to the paper.</p>

<p>It says: “A major advantage of our proposal is that it would encourage innovation and diversity on the part of educational institutions, both colleges and universities”.</p>

<p>The new proposal would cost £8.5 billion a year, significantly cheaper than Labour’s suggestion of simply abolishing tuition fees, claim the authors of the paper.</p>

<h2>Taking a wider approach</h2>

<p>They state: “The proposal takes the debate beyond the current narrow focus on university education and student debt, to a broader and more inclusive system which would encourage learning at all ages by a diverse range of students, at a lower cost than the abolition of tuition fees”.</p>

<p>University undergraduates could use the entitlement of up to £5,000 a year over two years to cut the cost of their fees, while those not wanting to go to university would be able to cover the cost of courses in further education, apprenticeships or other accredited routes. There would be no time limit on when the money would have to be spent.</p>

<p>Further education and FE students “are grotesquely neglected” in the public debate over education, according to the paper.</p>

<p>It says: “Unfamiliarity, snobbery and sheer prejudice are some of the reasons for this neglect. It’s time that changed. More money needs to go into the system, but on a different and much broader basis.”</p>

<p>Mark Dawe, chief executive, Association of Employment and Learning Providers, said: “This is certainly an interesting idea that is worth exploring further. However, we need to think carefully how to allocate scarce resource for education and training, especially for 18- to 24-year-olds, because of our overriding concerns about the negative impact on social mobility that many policies are having at the moment”.</p>

<h2>Government view</h2>

<p>A DfE spokesperson said: “The current student finance system is fair, sustainable and progressive. The loan system minimises upfront costs for students and ensures that individuals only make their contribution to the system when they can afford to do so.""</p>

<p>They added: ""Furthermore, through the introduction of the apprenticeship levy – anyone over the age of 16 undertaking an approved apprenticeship has their training costs covered. For those employers who don’t pay the levy the government pays 90 per cent of the training costs for an apprenticeship, up to the maximum band limit.""</p>

<p>Advanced Learner Loans are also available to thousands of adults wishing to retrain, ""helping them to meet upfront fees and removing one of the main barriers to learning,"" according to the spokesperson.</p>

"375255","Are struggling schools doing the wrong CPD?","/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/are-struggling-schools-doing-wrong-cpd","A new report from the Wellcome Trust highlights the need for more funding and support to stop the gap between schools growing wider, argues David Weston","<p>Are we creating a CPD “Matthew Effect” where the successful become subject-richer and the poor become subject-poorer? A new report suggests that this is the case.</p>

<p>The Wellcome Trust has just released <em>Developing Great Subject Teaching</em>, a report which finds that teachers in struggling schools are less likely to get subject-specific CPD than teachers in flourishing schools.</p>

<p>And yet, the 2015 predecessor research, <em>Developing Great Teaching</em>, found that subject-specific CPD is more effective, in terms of its impact on pupil outcomes, than generic pedagogic CPD. Not only that, this new study finds that while teachers tend to be more interested in subject-specific development than school leaders, teachers in struggling schools have much less influence over their CPD than their peers. When they do manage to get any subject-specific input, it tends to be limited to one teacher, who is supposed to “cascade” the knowledge back to colleagues.</p>

<p>This is not good enough. It’s feasible that turning around a struggling school requires additional focus on some of the basics, but this should be in addition to a regular diet of quality training. We need to make our most-challenged schools into places that are steeped in professional support and development opportunities.</p>

<p><em>Developing Great Subject Teaching</em> explores subject-specific support for teachers. There are findings that should give policy makers and school leaders plenty to think about.</p>

<h2>Weakening schools and systems</h2>

<p>Across the UK, but in England in particular, the weakening of local authorities appears to have been associated with a weakening of subject provision. The school-led model is, the report suggests, leading to a prevalence of generic and whole-school approaches, reducing the likelihood of subject-specific training for teachers.</p>

<p>Primary schools seem to be particularly hard-hit. Given their scale, they tend to focus on English and maths. In Wales at least, primary schools intend to keep a focus on science (and Welsh), but across both countries the provision beyond this is much weaker. Despite this, primary teachers seem to value the small amount of subject-specific support they get.</p>

<p>Scotland comes out well, with schools reporting valued relationships between local-authority subject specialists, higher-education institutes and schools. In Wales and particularly in England, such specialist roles have broadly disappeared.</p>

<p>To some extent, support from local authorities has been replaced by private providers, government-funded networks and school-led provision, though this is mainly found in the “core” subjects. There is evidence that some multi-academy trusts have invested in subject-specific expertise in their core teams, although this is not yet common across all MATs.</p>

<p>A particularly fascinating finding from the research review is the emerging differences in what makes effective development across subjects. The study explores maths, English and science. The effective approaches to CPD in each seem to mirror the dominant approaches to teaching those subjects.</p>

<p>In maths, the most effective CPD often began with explicit, direct teaching and modelling of key principles. In science, effective teacher development often involved experimenting with classroom tools and equipment. In English, some of the most effective approaches involved teachers delving into challenging texts about pedagogy, followed by in-depth debates and discussions.</p>

<h2>Insufficient attention</h2>

<p>In all areas, the two least-effective subject-specific development approaches were programmes that tried to enforce change in practice and the introduction of new knowledge with insufficient attention to how it can be applied in the classroom.</p>

<p>Developing Great Subject Teaching ends with a few bright spots and challenges for all of us. It highlights impending curriculum and policy change in Scotland and Wales as a great opportunity to make improvements – and flags up England’s recent investment in professional and curriculum development.</p>

<p>Across the UK, the authors note an urgent need to strengthen approaches to teachers’ professional development and subject-specific support. This is impossible without investment in training for school leaders.</p>

<p>We need a new national network of CPD leadership experts who can ensure teachers get access to the support they need – through courses, consultants, internal collaboration and joint-practice development.</p>

<p>The challenges are large but the opportunity is great. The evidence is clearer than ever: the subject-rich are getting richer all the time. The divide is getting wider.</p>

<p>Researchers discovered that some coaches are buying products in bulk and selling them to their students, and that a lack of knowledge about nutrition and supplements among teachers and students could leave pupils at risk of taking banned substances.</p>

<p>According to new research from Leeds Beckett University – the first in-depth study to explore schoolboy supplement use – student rugby players may be at a heightened risk of doping because there is a greater drive to build muscle and use nutritional supplements in the sport.</p>

<p>The study found that use of banned substances was judged to be a serious issue in school that needed attention, with just over one-third of schoolboys showing a degree of willingness to try a “risky” substance.</p>

<p>It also found that teachers and coaches help shape a perception among their students that “size matters” and sometimes encourage supplement use – even though they often have little knowledge about their health benefits or effects.</p>

<p>Pupils from one school who were interviewed in the study spoke about how they had been supplied with supplements by their teacher.</p>

<p>One student said: “Recently, like the start of this year, [the rugby teachers] ordered a load of shakers in bulk and one of them had a contact with some protein supplier and he ordered a load of tubs of it and sold it to us.""</p>

<p>A second pupil said: “My coach got us some deals on all the different supplements. He orders it for us and we pay him because he knows someone that supplies it.”</p>

<p>“You can buy protein shakes from the teachers and stuff from the sports teacher so you are encouraged to take supplements,” commented a third student.</p>

<p>The study warns: “Without clear boundaries, those coaches and teachers who promote 'substance' use (in one instance this involved buying in bulk and selling it on to players)<strong> </strong>are fostering a climate that might encourage doping.”</p>

<p>However, the research also found support for more education on the subject in schools. Forty-seven per cent of schoolboys surveyed reported that they would be likely or very likely to attend anti-doping workshops, and 83 per cent of teachers agreed that education on supplements and banned substances should be compulsory within schools.</p>

<p>Professor Susan Backhouse, of Leeds Beckett’s Carnegie School of Sport, led the research, which was commissioned by the Rugby Football Union.</p>

<p>She said: “Nutritional supplement use was found to go hand-in-glove with regular gym attendance and the interviews pointed to ‘the gym’ as a doping risk environment, where substance use is embedded within that social and cultural system.”</p>

<p>Professor Backhouse added: “Our findings point to schoolboy rugby union being a fertile ground for progression from habitual use of permitted performance-enhancing strategies to prohibited substance use because of implicit and explicit pressures noted in their environments.”</p>

<p>The study was based on in-depth interviews with students at four schools, as well as surveys carried out by 135 teachers and 771 schoolboys.</p>

<p>Theresa May is expected to use a speech on Monday to announce details of the government’s review of university funding.</p>

<p>Options include cutting annual tuition fees, which are currently set at a maximum of £9,250 a year, to £6,000.</p>

<p><em><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/feb/16/theresa-may-details-tuition-fee-overhaul"">The Guardian</a> </em>said that the proposal would see the government “dismantle” requirements that universities spend money on activities on encouraging poorer pupils to apply to university and bursaries for those from poorer backgrounds.</p>

<p>At <a href=""https://www.conservatives.com/sharethefacts/2017/10/theresa-mays-conference-speech"">last year’s Conservative Party conference</a>, the prime minister pledged “a major review of university funding and student financing”.</p>

<p>However, there were reports that Justine Greening and Jo Johnson – then education secretary and universities minister respectively – were opposed to Ms May’s proposals. Both ministers left the Department for Education in last month’s reshuffle.</p>

<p>Tweeting about today’s reports, Sam Freedman, a former adviser for Michael Gove at the DfE, said: “This is literally the worst thing you could do on tuition fees. Straight transfer from poor to rich.”</p>

<p>Mr Freedman, who is now executive director of Teach First, later added: “I can't believe that will end up being the proposal. If it is then everyone will mobilise against it!”</p>

<p>Weeks after leaving government, Ms Greening called for a more ""progressive"" system to cover living costs for university students than maintenance loans, which replaced grants.</p>

<p>She told BBC Radio 4’s <em>Today</em> programme: ""That means, I think wrongly, to be perfectly frank, that young people from more disadvantaged poorer backgrounds are coming out like for like on the same course with more debt than their better-off peers.”</p>

<p>The former education secretary said she had been against a review of student finance because ""the danger of a review is that you just kick things into the long grass"".</p>

<p>There have already been fears that the government <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/exclusive-fears-grow-uni-tuition-fees-cut-will-trigger-school-funding"">could use school funding</a> to pay for any cut in university tuition fees.</p>

<p>The revelation follows indications that the new education secretary, <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/exclusive-grammars-view-damian-hinds-appointment-boost-expansion"">Damian Hinds</a>, is more supportive of expanding selective provision than his predecessor, Justine Greening.</p>

<p>Comprehensive Future, a campaign group opposed to selection, submitted a freedom of information request to the DfE in January on whether the department had been contacted in the past 12 months by grammars looking to expand by setting up new annexes.<br />
<br />
According to the DfE’s response, three grammars have approached it about expanding on to a separate site from their existing school – one in January 2017 and two in February 2017.</p>

<p>Currently, creating completely new selective schools is against the law.</p>

<p>Theresa May set out plans to change this when she became prime minister in 2016, but these were <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/if-election-result-means-one-thing-education-its-plans-new-grammar"">scuppered when she lost her Commons majority in last summer’s general election</a>.</p>

<p>However, the existing legal framework does allow existing grammars to expand or open new schools as “annexes”.</p>

<p>While <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/legal-challenge-grammar-school-annexe-sevenoaks-put-hold"">Weald of Kent Grammar School</a> delivered on a long-held plan to open an annexe in Sevenoaks last September, Ms Greening did not view new grammar schools as a priority during her time as education secretary.</p>

<h2>Hinds 'looking at grammar school expansion'</h2>

<p>However, Mr Hinds – a former grammar school boy – appears to be <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/exclusive-grammars-view-damian-hinds-appointment-boost-expansion"">more positive about expanding selective provision</a>.</p>

<p>In an <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/grammar-school-expansion-and-faith-school-reforms-damian-hinds-sets"">interview this weekend</a>, he said: “When it is possible for them to expand, physically, I want them to be able to expand. </p>

<p>“There are capital sources available for most schools to be able to do that when they want to. I’m looking at how to also facilitate that for selective schools.”</p>

<p>The DfE did not name the three schools that have requested to open annexes, but Comprehensive Future has asked the department which local authorities they are located in and how far from the original building the annexe is planned.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.kentonline.co.uk/herne-bay/news/renewed-hopes-of-new-town-160164/"">The <em>Herne Bay Gazette</em></a> has reported that Barton Court, a grammar school in Canterbury, is interested in opening a school in Herne Bay, Kent. The pro-grammar local Conservative MP, Sir Roger Gale, has said he would talk to Mr Hinds about the idea.</p>

<p>Melissa Benn, chair of Comprehensive Future, criticised annexes as a “backdoor route” to new grammar schools aimed at “avoiding existing laws”.</p>

<p>She said: “It is disappointing to hear that Damian Hinds is keen to expand ‘good school places’ for the few, while reducing the educational chances of the many. It’s hard not to despair at politicians returning over and over again to failed policies.</p>

<p>“The opening of annexes is clearly a backdoor route to new grammar schools and all about avoiding existing laws.""</p>

<p>She added: ""We know that expanding selection changes the education landscape of communities and creates more of a secondary modern effect in surrounding schools. The government should listen to evidence and build good new schools that work for everyone.</p>

<p>""The grammar school obsession is all about pleasing a certain sort of voter and not about sensible education policy.”</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.sfc.ac.uk/publications-statistics/statistical-publications/statistical-publications-2018/SFCST022018.aspx"">College performance indicators</a> for 2016-17 show that only 65.3 per cent of full-time further education students successfully completed their course that year – 0.2 per cent fewer than in 2015-16. The figures also show that of the 26 colleges delivering full-time FE courses in 2016-17, only nine had improved success rates in comparison to the previous year, while 17 recorded a decline in the proportion successfully completing their course.</p>

<p>According to the SFC, while the proportion of students completing successfully has dropped slightly, that still means 4,725 additional full-time FE students successfully completed their course in 2016-17, compared to 2008-09.</p>

<h2>Student number target exceeded</h2>

<p>The SFC publication also stressed that in addition to the almost two-thirds of students who gained the desired qualification at the end of their course, a further 9.6 per cent completed their course without achieving the qualification they were aiming for by the end of the academic year. Some of those may gain the award at a later time, it said.</p>

<p>The Scottish college sector exceeded its student number target for 2016-17, delivering 117,502 full-time equivalent SFC funded student places.</p>

<p>Shona Struthers, chief executive at Colleges Scotland, said the fact colleges had exceeded their target showed that colleges were continuing to “punch above their weight and provide opportunities for people to gain skills, upskill, retrain and enter employment”. </p>

<p>She added: “It is encouraging to see that there are now over 11,000 more full-time further education and higher education students successfully completing their courses, compared to 2008-09. Colleges are the linchpin upon which Scotland’s ambitions for inclusive economic growth will be realised and work closely with schools, universities and employers to deliver a skilled workforce that meets the needs of the economy.” </p>

<h2>Indicative funding allocations</h2>

<p>The SFC also announced its <a href=""http://www.sfc.ac.uk/news/2018/news-65802.aspx"">indicative funding allocations </a>for colleges, announcing an increase in the revenue budget for colleges by 8.3 per cent to nearly £600 million, with the college capital budget also increasing by nearly £30 million to £76.7 million. Student support funding will increase by £3.6 million, the government said, with an extra £5.2 million set aside for the implementation of the Independent Review of Student Support, which published its findings only months ago.</p>

<p>Scottish FE minister Shirley-Anne Somerville said: “Universities and colleges are one of the cornerstones of Scotland’s education system, supporting people of all ages to fulfil their potential in life.” She added the government was looking to colleges “to respond flexibly to the demands and challenges of the labour market, delivering on areas of priority like early learning and childcare, to ensure our workforce is fit for the future”.  </p>

<h2>Welcome boost</h2>

<p>Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the EIS teaching union, which represents college lecturers in Scotland, said the funding marked “a welcome boost to the resources available to the further and higher education sectors”. “These increases in funding will help colleges and universities invest in the staffing and resources that are required to widen access and enhance course provision for young people and mature learners in the year ahead. These funds will also ensure that universities and colleges have the finances available to meet their obligations to staff on pay, conditions and pensions,” he said.</p>

<p>The NUS Scotland student union president Luke Humberstone said continued investment in teaching grants was positive news for students, who see first-hand the benefits that well-resourced colleges and a properly remunerated college lecturing staff can bring.</p>

<p>However, he added: “While initial investment to implement the proposals of the independent student support review is welcome, it’s a drop in the ocean when you consider the reform the system needs. We hope to see a bold and ambitious response to the findings of the student-support review from the Scottish government – and soon.”</p>

","<p>The success rate in almost two-thirds of Scottish colleges has dropped, according to new figures from the Scottish Funding Council (SFC).</p>

<p>Last year, 93,000 pupils – 16.5 per cent of the total – <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/617876/SFR24_2017_AppsOffers_Text.pdf"">did not receive a place at their first-choice secondary school</a>, representing a small rise on the 15.9 per cent who missed out in the previous year.</p>

<p>The nationwide figure masked wide geographical variations, with the proportion getting into their prefered school ranging from 98.2 per cent in Northumberland to 53.6 per cent in Hammersmith and Fulham.</p>

<p>Across the country, 94.6 per cent of pupils secured a place at one of their top three secondary schools.</p>

<p>It comes at a time that the <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/need-know-five-key-trends-secondary-school-admissions"">number of secondary school pupils is rising</a>.</p>

<p>Local councils are legally responsible for ensuring there are sufficient school places, but cannot order academies to expand to help achieve this.</p>

<p>Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT headteachers' union, said: “In an increasingly fragmented school system, we lack a coordinated approach to place planning. Instead, it’s haphazard; decisions are being made in isolation and new schools and new school places are not always being commissioned in the areas they are most needed.”</p>

<p>He said there was “a desperate need for long-term planning that spans all sectors”, and added: “Until some agency at the local or regional level has the information and the clout to prioritise school places where they are most needed, parents and children will always be unsure that the system will give them what they want.”</p>

<p>When approached by <em>Tes</em>, the DfE did not comment on the issue, and instead referred to a media statement in which school standards minister Nick Gibb said the government is investing £5.8 billion to create school places, following the creation of 735,000 places since 2010.</p>

<p>Last year, an analysis of DfE data showed that <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/number-pupils-offered-preferred-secondary-school-place-falls-most"">80 out of 151 councils saw a drop in the proportion of pupils given their first choice of secondary school</a> in 2016.</p>

<p>At the time, the Local Government Association said existing academies should be made to expand where needed, or councils should regain powers to open new maintained schools.</p>

"376506","Good data is the best benchmark for monitoring primary schools","/news/school-news/breaking-views/good-data-best-benchmark-monitoring-primary-schools","Councils and the new regional improvement collaboratives need to make sure the figures can be trusted","<p>Rubbish in, rubbish out. This is a toned-down version of an expression in management circles that sums up what happens if the quality of the data you base your decisions on is bad.</p>

<p>And that’s one potential stumbling block for the government’s new literacy and numeracy benchmarking tool for primary schools, which is gradually making its way into councils. Many question the quality of the information that is being fed into it.</p>

<p>The tool will – for the first time – enable primary headteachers to easily compare their school’s performance in literacy and numeracy with any school in Scotland. It will also generate a virtual comparator based on the characteristics of their pupils – including factors such as levels of disadvantage, gender and ethnicity – to ensure they are as far as possible able to compare like with like.</p>

<p>The tool will tell headteachers about the real schools operating in contexts similar to theirs, with the intention of sparking conversations and “learning and collaborating with others”, as the education secretary John Swinney puts it.</p>

<p>It was two years ago that the government began reporting whether pupils in P1, P4, P7 and S3 were attaining the expected level for their age and stage in reading, writing, listening and talking and numeracy, based on teacher judgements. The figures show huge fluctuations in pupil performance between councils. What remains unclear is whether these fluctuations are caused by children exceling in some areas and floundering in others, or differences in the way teachers rate pupil performance.</p>

<h2>'Experimental' figures</h2>

<p>The government has warned against using the figures to compare councils in the past, saying they are “experimental” and the deprivation context of councils must be considered when interpreting the statistics. It says the data will become more reliable over time with the advent of the new standardised assessments in literacy and numeracy, which pupils are due to sit for the first time this year. The results of the assessments will not be recorded on the tool, but with teachers using the tests to inform their judgements the hope is that consistency improves.</p>

<p>It is questionable how much credence headteachers will give the new platform. If they are told they are being outranked by the virtual comparator, will they dismiss the findings, believing the data is flawed? And if they compare themselves to the brick and mortar “similar schools” the tool will generate for them and find they come out badly, will they take heed?</p>

<p>The second issue is that the tool is extremely narrow. Primary school is about much more then learning how to read, write and count. Colin Sutherland, the retired headteacher who helped design Insight, the benchmarking tool for the secondary schools, warned that you have to be careful what you measure because it becomes the focus. He predicted that a tool for benchmarking in primary would focus on the three “responsibility of all” areas of the curriculum: literacy, numeracy and health and wellbeing.</p>

<p>Health and wellbeing is conspicuous by its absence. But this, of course, is the tool’s first iteration and it may go on to become about more than literacy and numeracy.</p>

<p>In the meantime, we need councils and the new regional improvement collaboratives to work hard to make sure these figures can be trusted, striving to get that consistency in judgment between teachers, between schools and between councils.</p>

<p>If they don’t, questions about the quality of the data will keep coming – and that could lead to the tool being populated not with teacher judgements, but with standardised assessment results instead.</p>

<p>If that comes to pass, Scotland will end up with the high-stakes testing regime everyone is so desperate to avoid.</p>

"377133","Doubling in pupils with visual impairments sparks 'urgent' call for extra support","/news/school-news/breaking-news/doubling-pupils-visual-impairments-sparks-urgent-call-extra-support","Scottish charity says specialist teachers are facing 'unreasonable pressures' as their numbers have fallen","<p>Figures revealing that the number of blind and partially-sighted children has more than doubled in recent years – as specialist teachers have been cut – show that extra support in school is “urgently” needed, a Scottish charity has warned.</p>

<p>The charity, Royal Blind, said the new <a href=""http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Statistics/Browse/School-Education/dspupcensus/dspupcensus17"">Scottish government figures</a> showed the number of vision-impaired pupils in Scotland at its highest ever level. Pupil Census data shows 4,331 pupils had vision impairment in 2017, up from 2,005 in 2010.</p>

<p>During the same period, there has been a <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/number-teachers-blind-drastically-dropping"">reduction in the number of specialist teachers</a> for pupils with vision impairment. Last year, Tes Scotland analysis highlighted <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/teachers-take-strain-after-depressing-decline-support-staff"">sharp falls in support staff roles</a> in Scottish schools.</p>

<p>The charity, which runs the Royal Blind School and Learning Hub, is concerned that the trends are leaving specialist teachers in vision impairment with “unreasonable pressures”. It has called on local authorities and the Scottish government to take “urgent action” to ensure the right support is in place in schools.</p>

<p>Chief executive Mark O’Donnell said: “Up to 80 per cent of our learning is through our use of vision, so it is vitally important that <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/ive-never-forgotten-her-a-heartwarming-reunion-between-teacher-and"">specialist support is provided for pupils with vision impairment</a>, who have a huge learning disadvantage in comparison to their fully-sighted peers.”</p>

<h2>Children in need</h2>

<p>Royal Blind, which is Scotland's largest vision-impairment charity, said there is a need for more research into the reasons for the increase, adding that the British Medical Journal has found <a href=""http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/7/9/e016888.full.pdf"">similar trends in England and Wales</a>.</p>

<p>A spokesman said: “Research shows children with rare conditions, many of whom will be vision-impaired, are living longer through improvements in treatment. A study by the University of Edinburgh showed that the risk of neonatal death from premature birth more than halved between 1980 and 2005, and Blind Children UK has estimated than one in 20 babies born prematurely are likely to be blind.”</p>

<p>The Scottish government has just completed consultation about guidance on the presumption that children will enter mainstream education, and is looking at the responses.</p>

<p>A spokeswoman said: “Children and young people should learn in the environment which best suits their needs, whether that is in a mainstream or special-school setting.”</p>

<p>She added that the government was working to implement recommendations from the Scottish Parliament’s education committee on attainment of pupils with sensory impairments, with an update due this year.</p>

<p>The government stressed that changes to information gathering in 2010 have led to a large increase in the overall number of pupils recorded as having additional needs. In January, it announced that teenagers in Scotland had the <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/asn-will-new-rights-help-pupils-get-proper-support"">right to ask for support and participate in meetings</a> about additional support needs (ASN). Ministers claimed that Scottish children now had the most rights in Europe in terms of entitlement to ask for support in school. </p>

<p>The call for more support for blind children comes a day after <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/oscar-win-film-highlighting-struggles-deaf-children-school"">a British short film won an Oscar</a> for its portrayal of the struggles faced by deaf children attending mainstream school.</p>
