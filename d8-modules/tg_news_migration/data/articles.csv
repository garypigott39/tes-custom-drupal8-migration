338576,The three words that could help teachers cope,"As more work lands on teachers’ plates, many no longer feel that they are offering students the level of support they deserve – and it’s causing some soul searching among the profession","<p>Earlier this month, I spoke to University of Glasgow science graduates who had decided to forgo a career in industry for less lucrative work as teachers. One told me that a year pursuing the former had proved unfulfilling. She switched to chemistry teaching and has since found the job satisfaction she craved.</p>

<p>The reasons are obvious: for all the frustrations of teaching, whether mushrooming workload, stagnating salaries or the shifting sands of national policy, it’s a profession that promises rich rewards.</p>

<p>There’s the instant gratification of seeing a pupil crack something they had thought beyond their ken, but also the knowledge that, decades down the line, your guidance in the classroom might be the fuel that drives people to success in all manner of spheres.</p>

<p>Teaching taps into our inner altruist. Gather a random selection of teachers and I’d wager that, for most, much of their career’s appeal is in being able to shape others’ lives for the better. Granted, this is not an Earth-shattering observation. Less obvious, however, is the heavy load this leaves teachers with if, for some reason, they feel unable to help pupils as much as they would like to.</p>

<p>When Fife teacher Jenny Harvey started an online poll on wellbeing in the profession, she expected a few responses and a handful of points to ponder. Much to her surprise, within a couple of days she had more than 500 often heartfelt replies, which showed many teachers struggling to cope with the demands of their job.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A tension emerges from the responses: the duties of a teacher have changed, but the reasons for being a teacher have not</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A tension emerges from the responses: the duties of a teacher have changed, but the reasons for being a teacher have not. Teachers have more and more landing on their plate, but as a result, despite their best efforts, some no longer feel that they are offering pupils the level of support they deserve. If the very reason that you became a teacher was to help others, but you feel unable to do so, that creates a powerful toxin against mental wellbeing.</p>

<p>A substantial minority of teachers surveyed said that they are on medication as a result of their work, with some being on the brink of leaving a profession they loved. The following reply from one teacher sums up many responses to the question of what would make the job better: “To go to work and not feel like nothing’s ever good enough and there are never enough hours in the day to do what I want to do for the children I teach; to not feel guilty about spending time with my own family when I have work to do.”</p>

<p>Tony McLaren, national convener of Breathing Space, the NHS mental health phoneline service, told TESS that demands on teachers are so singular – as a profession for which so many people will come to you with their difficulties – that, in an ideal world, there would be a dedicated helpline for teachers and counsellors in every school.</p>

<p>The wellbeing survey shows that many teachers feel underappreciated – not only are they going the extra mile, but few seem to appreciate the great efforts they are making. As one respondent put it, their experience of work would improve simply by “being told ‘thank you’”. That won’t solve everything but, says McLaren, “Sometimes just asking if someone is OK could make a big difference”.</p>

<p>In the midst of a workload maelstrom, it’s easy to put your head down and fixate on the task in hand. But just imagine the profound ripple effect if everyone in a school looked up, even once a day, and asked a colleague one simple question: “How are you?”</p>

338588,"Rest assured, relaxation is what teachers need","If the half-term holiday hasn’t left you feeling restored, then now is the time to plan for a proper break at Easter, says one deputy head","<p>For some of you, this weekend marks the end of the joy of half-term, and the impending return to school. Of course, you’ll have no sympathy from the rest of us who have been back at the chalkface for what seems like several months already. We had our day in the sun, and most of us probably squandered it. After all, what is the February half-term holiday for, if not recovering from the fact that you barely stopped for a day over Christmas?</p>

<p>The fact that we’ve had six or seven weeks of work in between hardly seems to matter. Talk to any teacher as the February break approaches and most will be looking forward to a week of doing very little, while remembering how busy they were during the Christmas holiday and that they therefore “didn’t get a proper rest”.</p>

<p>This strikes me as the nature of teachers’ thinking. Just as many of us feel like we have a completely different appetite system for main courses and desserts, so we switch between two completely different mindsets during term and holiday time. Of course, our immune systems have a similar problem, which seems rather flawed, but this is our lot.</p>

<h2><font color=""0083BD"">Life before teaching</font></h2>

<p>Sometimes it makes me wonder how people in other professions cope with their 28 days’ annual leave. But then I remember my life before being a teacher, when it was just fine. Because those 28 days were sacrosanct, but so were the hours after I left the office, and so were the other 104 weekend days all through the year.</p>

<p>The thing with teaching is that it’s not the 9am-3pm that does for us. It’s not even the 8am-5pm that makes the job so draining. It’s the 5pm-9pm time at home and the long hours each weekend that make term-time so exhausting. The joy of holidays is less in not having to drag yourself into work and more in not having to drag all the work back home with you.</p>

<p>No doubt there will be teachers reading this and complaining that I’ve got no idea just how much work they’ve taken home with them over the holidays, and I’m sure that’s true. But it’s perhaps indicative of the wider problem. If holidays are needed to catch up with the term-time workload, that rather suggests the workload isn’t realistic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If holidays are needed to catch up with workload, then that suggests the workload isn’t realistic</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m not arguing for 13 weeks of sun, sea and sand – as nice as that would be. I’ll happily spend a few hours during the break on planning an interesting unit of work for the term ahead. But after two years in my current school, the basic framework for the new curriculum is in place. The decisions that I make to update the planning, and alter the resources are as much about improving my work (and my enjoyment of it) as they are a necessity. If a school is still expecting teachers to plan everything from scratch each year, then something has gone wrong somewhere.</p>

<p>I recently read materials from the old National College in which a headteacher prided herself on setting aside one evening a week where she ate dinner with her family. How can that ever be a viable way of working? And what possible model is she setting for the staff in her school if she thinks that’s a good example?</p>

<p>If this half-term holiday hasn’t left you feeling rested and ready to return for the new stint, then maybe now is the time to plan ahead for Easter. Plan for a proper rest. And if you’re a school leader, make sure your school team have that opportunity, too. That’s how you’ll keep them.</p>

338723,A day in the life of…Farah Shah,"Balancing work life as a devoted teacher and home life as a devoted mother has proved challenging for this Pakistani teacher, but she is glad she has persevered","<p>I was very happy the day I received my Bachelors in Education from the Ali Institute of Education in Lahore Pakistan, and I was even more thrilled when my father gave me permission to work. This is not a chance that every young woman in Pakistan has. But my father accompanied me to my interview at the CARE Foundation’s teacher training centre, where I was hired to teach maths at a local high school.</p>

<p>I began my first day of teaching with immense enthusiasm and excitement. When you are young and fresh out of college, you can’t wait to go out there and change the world through teaching.</p>

<p>However, my illusions were soon shattered. The school was serving the underprivileged children of the city and the level of poverty that they lived in was apparent. The school was in dire need of more furniture and the majority of classes had to sit on thin rugs on the floor. It was a different reality to the one that I knew.</p>

<p>I was put in charge of the weakest class in the senior section, which proved to be a challenge for me. The job required me to pour my heart and soul into it from the very start, because I wanted my class to do well.</p>

<p>On a typical day, I would be busy with school from morning until noon. After coming home, I would help my mother with chores and then take care of my younger siblings before making a lesson plan for the next day. Life was busy, but my students were improving in leaps and bounds and when my first class passed all their exams with flying colours, it was the happiest day of my life.</p>

<h2><font color=""7005A5"">Balancing teaching and family commitments</font></h2>

<p>After I got married and had children of my own it became more difficult to balance my teaching with family commitments. My husband had no objections to me continuing to teach, but in our culture, men don’t help much with household chores and raising children. For me, getting married meant taking on a lot of responsibility outside of work.</p>

<p>Soon, I realised that I was not giving enough attention to my own children at home and I was torn between wanting to be a good mother and a good teacher. But teaching comes so naturally to me. If I were to leave now, I wouldn’t know what else to be.</p>

<p>Wherever you live, being a mother and a teacher is difficult. It requires strength, motivation, patience and dedication. To flourish in your career, you have to sacrifice precious moments at home.</p>

<p>I chose to remain in teaching and I am glad that I did. Today I am a successful teacher and have been promoted to the position of a coordinator at the CDG Girls High School in Qainchi, Lahore. I am thankful to God for helping me reach a point in my career where I’m receiving immense praise from my headmistress, as well as my fellow colleagues. My students are bright and talented and I know they are more successful as a result of the time, effort and heart that I devote to them.</p>

338744,Quarter of school leaders ‘preparing to leave education’,"But heads and teachers could be persuaded to stay if workload is cut, YouGov poll suggests
","<p>More than a quarter of senior school leaders don’t expect to be in education beyond the next one to two years, according to YouGov poll findings seen by <em>TES</em>.</p>

<p>However, the overwhelming majority who took part in the survey said they were open to being persuaded to stay in the profession – <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/level-workload-expected-teachers-not-improving-schools-it-wrecking"">particularly if workloads were reduced</a>.</p>

<p>In the YouGov survey commissioned by the Education Support Partnership charity and shared with <em>TES</em>, 27 per cent of senior school leaders said they did not expect to be working in education beyond the next one to two years.</p>

<p>Of a total of 865 teachers and school leaders surveyed, 43 per cent said they did not expect to be working in the sector beyond five years.</p>

<p>Education Support Partnership runs a free and confidential 24-hour helpline that receives more than 30,000 calls a year from school staff experiencing difficulties.</p>

<p>The charity’s chief executive, Julian Stanley, said the poll findings reflected “what so many tell us when they call in crisis: that many staff working at every level in schools are feeling overwhelmed”.</p>

<h2>'Enough is enough'</h2>

<p>He said it was “particularly worrying” that senior leaders with “immense experience” were saying “enough is enough”.</p>

<p>Russell Hobby, general secretary of the NAHT heads’ union, said he was alarmed by the proportion of senior leaders inclined to leave education.</p>

<p>“You’re always going to get a proportion that is ready to leave, but that’s high,” he said.</p>

<p>However, the poll also reveals that respondents were willing to be persuaded to stay.</p>

<p>In total, only 7 per cent of teachers and leaders said “nothing” would positively influence them to stay in education.</p>

<p>The biggest factor that could influence their decision was workload – 79 per cent of senior leaders and 76 per cent of all teachers and leaders said reducing workload would influence them to stay.</p>

<p>Mr Hobby said the fact that a majority of teachers and school leaders could still be persuaded to stay “exposes how badly managed the system is”.</p>

<p>“These are not people who have completely given up or lost the will to work – they’re people who feel they no longer can,” he added.</p>

<p>A Department for Education spokeswoman said: “We recognise the importance of schools being able to retain good teachers as well as recruit them, which is why we have focused actions in key areas that are of concern to teachers – <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/justine-greening-no-end-qts-my-watch"">like tackling unnecessary workload</a> and improving teachers’ ability to manage poor pupil behaviour.</p>

<p>“Our latest Workforce Statistics show that teacher retention has been broadly stable for the past 20 years. We’ve also seen a significant rise in the number of teachers returning to the profession after some time out, with returners having increased by 20 per cent in the four years up to 2015.”</p>

339431,Double measures: councils vow to keep local testing,Councils’ refusal to move exclusively to national tests could see pupils assessed twice,"<p>At least nine councils will continue to run their own standardised testing regimes when the Scottish government introduces national assessments in literacy and numeracy in August, <em>TESS</em> has learned.</p>

<p>Carrying on with the tests will fly in the face of assurances given by the first minister, and result in some pupils being tested every year from P1 to S3.</p>

<p>When first minister Nicola Sturgeon announced in 2015 that the Scottish government would reintroduce national standardised testing, she stated that the assessments would “replace the variety of different assessments already used by local authorities” – so there would be no increase in teacher workload.</p>

<p>However, a <em>TESS</em> survey, which has received responses from 30 of Scotland’s 32 local authorities, reveals that only eight councils are prepared to commit to moving over exclusively to the new national assessments being introduced by the government in August to test pupils’ literacy and numeracy skills in P1, P4, P7 and S3.</p>

<p>Nine councils told <em>TESS</em> that they would keep running their own local testing regimes for at least another year in conjunction with the new national assessments; and a further three – Glasgow, Perth and Kinross, and South Lanarkshire – said they had no local testing regime but that individual schools currently buy in standardised assessments and they would continue to be free to do so.</p>

<p>The remaining 10 councils said they had yet to take a decision on whether local arrangements would be scrapped.</p>

<p>Many of the undecided councils commented that they felt unable to commit exclusively to the new national tests – due to be introduced in just five months’ time – because they had not seen them and did not know if they were “as good as, better, or less informative” than those currently in use.</p>

<p>Last month <em>TESS</em> reported that the pilot period for the tests had been cut drastically and the process was more than half a year behind the original schedule – and two months behind the revised timetable.</p>

<h2><font color=""00AEEF"">Workload warning</font></h2>

<p>The survey prompted opposition parties to brand the Scottish government’s national testing policy “a shambles”.</p>

<p>The situation has also been described as “madness” by teaching union bosses, who are calling on the government to do more to ensure that councils scrap local tests.</p>

<p>The running of local and national testing regimes in tandem will result in additional workload for teachers, the unions said.</p>

<p>Pupils’ learning experiences will be the “casualties” because the testing will eat into the time that could be spent on “meaningful learning and teaching” in the classroom, they added. The unions also highlighted the cost of running both local and national standardised assessments – money that could be invested in other things.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The government needs to be strong – there should be no other testing going on</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A survey conducted by <em>TESS</em> in 2015 found that Scotland’s 32 local authorities spent more than £1 million on local testing arrangements. The tests that are due to be introduced by the Scottish government will cost £2 million per year.</p>

<p>Seamus Searson, general secretary of the Scottish Secondary Teachers’ Association, said: “It’s just madness. If this is what the government wants to use then the councils should have no choice but to use them and trust the government on their decision. The government needs to be strong on this – there should be no other testing going on.”</p>

<p>The EIS union accused councils of developing a “fixation” with standardised assessment.</p>

<p>“We understand the Scottish government is speaking to directors of education about this need to reduce the amount of standardised testing going on in some local authorities,” said Andrea Bradley, EIS assistant secretary.</p>

<h2><font color=""00AEEF"">Pupil 'casualties'</font></h2>

<p>“From our point of view, those conversations need to be resumed because it is simply not tenable that some children are going to be tested every year of their schooling from P1 to S3.</p>

<p>“That will mean huge time taken from learning and teaching, and significant additional bureaucracy for teachers. Young people’s learning experiences will be the casualties.”</p>

<p>Liz Smith, Scottish Conservative shadow education secretary, said the point of standardised testing was to ensure common standards across the country.</p>

<p>“It will create both a great deal of confusion as well as an added workload for teachers if there are wide variations across local authorities of testing,” she added.</p>

<p>Iain Gray, Scottish Labour’s shadow education secretary, said: “The Scottish government’s national assessment policy has been a shambles from the beginning…Teachers have no confidence in these assessments as a replacement for current established practice. So it’s no wonder that only eight Scottish councils are certain they will move over to the new national assessments.</p>

<p>“If the Nationalists expect people to believe education is their number one priority, they need to get a grip of this situation, and fast.”</p>

<p>A Scottish government spokesperson said that the government was working closely with local authorities to ensure that the new national standardised assessments met their needs and could replace the various standardised assessments that councils are currently buying in.</p>

339812,‘You somehow imposed your own prejudices on education’ – one primary teacher’s extraordinary open letter to Michael Gove ,"The most shocking thing about Michael Gove's reign as education secretary was that one individual was able to change the system so much for the worse, writes this primary teacher
","<p>Dear Mr Gove,</p>

<p>I see that you are driving yourself back into the public eye. You came back on to my radar with your scoop of an interview with Donald Trump. I noted the grin, the twinkle in your eyes (<em>à la</em> Nigel Farage in a gold-plated lift) <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/16/michael-gove-cheesy-puff-donald-trump-interview"">as you posed for a ""thumbs up"" photograph</a> with the then president-elect. Your mutual appreciation was evident and hardly surprising, given that you appear to share many of the same ideas and core beliefs.</p>

<p>Firstly, Michael, you and Trump both appear to share an insatiable need to be in the public eye. How else to explain Trump’s early morning tweets? How else to explain your rapid return to the spotlight after such an ignominious debacle in the days following the Brexit referendum?</p>

<p>Moreover, both of you share a belief in belittling the opinions of experts, whether they be civil servants or career professionals in a specialised field. We all know Trump's views on the “swamp” of the Washington bureaucracy and his views on environmentalism, despite the accepted wisdom of a vast majority of scientists. In recent days, you have argued that your anti-expert rhetoric during the referendum has been misconstrued. However, as long as seven years ago, you were already demonstrating, by your actions, a deeply held distrust of expert educational opinion.</p>

<p>As you embarked on your <a href=""http://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/michael-gove-too-early-say-if-everything-i-did-education-secretary"">role as education secretary</a>, you set out to put to one side the views of civil servants within the Department of Education, to disregard the prevailing wisdom of the teaching profession, in order <a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/3be49734-29cb-11e6-83e4-abc22d5d108c"">to </a><a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/new-national-curriculum-has-dire-consequences-humanities"">oversee an overhaul of the national curriculum</a>. The new document proved to be, to an almost fantastical degree, the personal educational manifesto of a single individual. By dint of the fact that you had been to school, by dint of the fact that you had experienced the power of an inspirational teacher or two, and by dint of the fact that you had (to your credit) a daughter in a state primary school, you had the arrogance, Michael, to believe that you alone had the expertise to design a curriculum for all.</p>

<p>What followed was the publication of a curriculum that included some good ideas – who could argue with the oft-quoted aim of desiring to expose children to the ""great thinkers""? However, in reality it was a massive missed opportunity to deliver a truly outstanding education system for the future. Through your fundamental misunderstanding of education, you increased (or in some cases, merely reorganised) the content of the curriculum, reducing it, in the process, to what is most easily measurable. Michael, it would have been much more innovative and powerful to refocus education on principles rather than facts. What we needed was an educational system which strove to be exceptional within a rapidly globalising world; which promoted understanding rather than recall; which used everything that we have learned from educational research to optimise children’s learning; which promoted sustainability rather than short-term performance. It took over 20 years for the original national curriculum to be modified – unfortunately, we are going to have to live with your version for a long time.</p>

<h2>A 'damaging' new leadership culture</h2>

<p>What is most shocking about your reign in education, Michael, was that one individual was able to impose his own beliefs and prejudices to such an extent, virtually unimpeded. For this, David Cameron must take the bulk of the responsibility. Your appropriating of power to deliver a personal agenda, albeit on a smaller scale, cannot fail but to remind one of somebody across the pond. We can only hope that the oft-quoted ""checks and balances"" of the US’ political system are more effective in curbing the excesses of Trump, than Cameron was in curbing yours.</p>

<p>Another damaging product of your period in education, Michael, has been a change in the culture of school leadership, which corresponds to your own style of leadership. Much has been spoken of legacies in recent weeks. Well a legacy of your period of office has been a change in culture within schools, which has been at best unhelpful and at worst downright damaging. This change is characterised by a movement away from collaborative endeavour, and a corresponding movement towards autocratic decision-making – a change which reflects the political move towards greater individualism.</p>

<p>One of the most powerful products of the Blair government’s education policy was the focus on collaborative endeavour. Education ministers actively sought the opinions and advice of experts in the field. This was manifested through the primary strategies which sought to collate and disseminate good practice. Basically, good practice was developed by teachers and advisers, shared between schools and modified accordingly. The culture in schools was much more inclusive; headteachers were actively encouraged, through the National College of School Leadership, to use more distributive models of leadership.</p>

<p>Under your leadership, Michael, the culture of leadership within the Department of Education changed, and this has filtered down into schools. Heads, for example, are now expected to be seen to ""lead"" on everything, especially on ""teaching and learning"". Modern heads feel it incumbent on themselves to be seen to be the one making decisions, to be seen to be leading from the front. This change in emphasis may seem small but it has led to a decline in interest in headship, a lowering of teacher morale (since their voices are less valued) and a subsequent increase in the numbers taking time off for stress-related illness or, even worse, leaving the profession. Such leadership affects teachers’ lives; it affects their mental wellbeing.</p>

<p>Cultures of leadership matter. Perhaps Obama’s greatest legacy is the culture of his leadership – a leadership characterised by honesty, dignity, humility and grace; characterised by listening and by collaboration. The culture of your leadership in education mattered, Michael – it will take a significant time before it is replaced by a more effective one.</p>

<p>It is also a culture that appears to be about to be repeated in Trump’s administration. No wonder, in <em>that</em> photo, that the two of you look so at ease with each other – a mutual admiration society. You have much in common.</p>

339818,Government announces extra £215m to improve SEND provision,But the new funding is branded a 'drop in the ocean' by teaching unions,"<p>Local councils across England are to receive an extra £215 million to improve the education of children with special educational needs and disability, the Department for Education announced today.</p>

<p>The amounts being allocated vary from £500,000 to more than £6.5 million, but are a “drop in the ocean” compared with what is actually needed, according to teaching unions.</p>

<p>However, the government claims the new funding will “transform the lives of thousands of children with <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/send"">special educational needs and disabilities</a>, by increasing school capacity and making it easier for them to access good school places”.</p>

<p>Councils will be free to invest the funding as they see fit – with suggested uses including building specialised classrooms, installing lifts or improving existing facilities. Other options could see councils buying mobility equipment or creating storage facilities for wheelchairs, ""learning kitchens"" to teach life skills or sensory rooms.</p>

<p>The new money can used in mainstream or special schools, early years settings, further education colleges or other provision for children and young people aged from 0-25, according to DfE officials. </p>

<h2>'It's just a sticking plaster'</h2>

<p>Edward Timpson, minister for vulnerable children and families, said: “Our multi-million pound investment will enable local councils to build new classrooms and improve facilities for pupils‎, ensuring that no child is left behind.”</p>

<p>However, the funding will not be available until 2018-19 and will be spread over three years. Malcolm Trobe, interim general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “We are very pleased with any government spending on education, particularly when it is aimed at helping young people with the greatest needs. Unfortunately, however, this is a drop in the ocean <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/ive-never-seen-sencos-so-worried-about-meeting-needs-pupils-send"">compared to what is needed</a>.”</p>

<p>He added: “Schools will have to make £3 billion of savings to their annual running costs by 2020, which will have a huge impact on the curriculum they are able to offer and the support they are able to give young people, because they will have far less staff.”</p>

<p>Dr Mary Bousted, general secretary of the ATL teaching union, said: “This amount will not go far enough to bring our buildings up to scratch for pupils with SEND…we hope that the chancellor will give schools a much-needed cash injection next week in the Budget, as this measure is simply another <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/exclusive-send-pupils-missing-out-more-ps100m-due-funding-cap"">sticking plaster</a> over a gaping wound.”</p>

<p>The new funding is “a step in the right direction,” said Richard Watts, chair of the Local Government Association's children and young people board. But he said: “However, it’s unclear how this one-off payment links with the Department for Education’s proposed changes to high-needs funding. This will reduce council and school flexibility to make additional funding available where there are rising demands for SEND support.”</p>

339854,New 'T-levels' to replace thousands of post-16 vocational qualifications,Philip Hammond expected to announce new 'T-level' technical qualifications in Wednesday's Budget,"<p>The government is to launch a new set of “T-level” qualifications aimed at establishing parity between academic and technical routes, according to reports.</p>

<p>The current system, where students pick from 13,000 different qualifications, will be replaced with just 15 standalone courses, dubbed “T-levels”, The Sunday Telegraph has reported.</p>

<p>Creating the 15 routes was one of the key recommendations of <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-news/sainsbury-review-triggers-biggest-change-post-16-education-70"">Lord Sainsbury's review into technical education</a>.</p>

<p>According to the newspaper possible titles for the 15 courses include engineering and manufacturing, business and administration, catering and hospitality, construction and social care.</p>

<p>A Treasury source linked the announcement to boosting Britain’s productivity ahead of Brexit.</p>

<p>“Now that we’re leaving Europe, we really need to up our game on this stuff. We cannot wait. We will soon be competing with every other country Brexit,” the source told the paper.</p>

<p>The rebranding of technical qualifications is <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-news/hammond-spend-ps500m-a-year-technical-education-reforms"">part of a wider package on post-16 skills</a>, which includes the commitment of an extra £500 million each year to increase the amount of training available for 16- to 19-year olds on the courses to over 900 hours a year.</p>

<p>The reformed T-levels are expected to be unveiled by Philip Hammond in Wednesday’s Budget.</p>

<p>Appearing on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show the morning, the chancellor said the country needed to do “significantly more in training and up-skilling our young people”, and “establish genuine parity of esteem” between academic and technical routes.</p>

<p>He said the government would “create a technical route which is as rigorous, as clear… and as well understood as the academic route is”.</p>

<p>It is hoped the T-level courses will be rolled out from 2019 and completed by 2020.</p>

<p>A Treasury source claimed it was “the most ambitious post-16 education reform since the introduction of A-levels 70 years ago”.</p>

340346,Apprenticeship reforms are all about quality,The minister says he believes that apprenticeships will be one of the greatest success stories of the decade,"<p>National Apprenticeship Week 2017 is unlike any other week. Not only are we celebrating the 10th year of the event, but we are also highlighting the best of the best and showcasing some of our most hardworking, aspirational apprentices and employers around the country – from Avon to Worcestershire.</p>

<p>Apprenticeships work. Some 90 per cent of all apprentices go on to work or further learning after they have completed an apprenticeship. This really is something to shout about.</p>

<p>It is fantastic to see that we have been making considerable progress towards Britain becoming an apprentice and skills nation.</p>

<p>Apprenticeship participation stands at nearly 900,000 – the highest figure on record.</p>

<p>With this in mind, the role of National Apprenticeship Week in raising the prestige of apprenticeships and transforming the nation’s skills base has never been more important.</p>

<h2><font color=""F26522"">Climbing the ladder of opportunity</font></h2>

<p>I’m passionate about apprenticeships because they give millions of people the chance to climb the ladder of opportunity, the ability to earn while they learn, and a way to get the jobs, security and prosperity they need for their futures.</p>

<p>Since I started my role as apprenticeships and skills minister – something that I am extremely proud of – I have been working tirelessly to make sure that apprenticeships are viewed as a high-quality option, alongside further and higher education, which provides opportunities for people to progress.</p>

<p>On the prestige of apprenticeships, our “Get In, Go Far” campaign features remarkable ambassadors who demonstrate the power of apprenticeships. I had the pleasure of meeting one of these ambassadors, Chris Achiampong, at the National Apprenticeship Awards this year.</p>

<p>We need to carry on working just as hard to make sure we get the message out there.</p>

<p>Our reforms to apprenticeships are all about quality, quality, quality. We do not just want 3 million apprenticeships by 2020, we want 3 million quality apprenticeships.</p>

<p>Since May 2015, around 780,000 apprenticeship have been started – this means 780,000 lives changing and improving. I want us to continue extending our ladder and building on this momentum.</p>

<p>This is why, as part of our reforms, we are putting employers in the driving seat. They are best-placed to know exactly what skills they need and are central to designing new quality apprenticeships.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I truly believe that apprenticeships will be one of the greatest success stories of the decade</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With our eight quality board members and an operational plan out for consultation, the Institute for Apprenticeships is well on its way to launching in April.</p>

<p>The key guarantor of apprenticeship standards, it will throw out any apprenticeships that are not good enough, ensuring that every apprenticeship is of high quality.</p>

<p>We are putting our money where our mouth is. Through the new apprenticeship levy, £2.5 billion will be invested in apprenticeships by 2019-20 – that is double the amount spent in 2010-11. With more money than ever, we will be helping people get into more and better quality training schemes.</p>

<p>I truly believe that apprenticeships will be one of the greatest success stories of the decade. I hope that National Apprenticeship Week 2017 inspires more employers and people to pursue an apprenticeship, helping us on our way to creating an apprenticeships and skills nation.</p>

340358,TES talks to… Deborah Eyre,"Famed for her work with high-attaining pupils, the academic tells Kaye Wiggins that all pupils could excel in any school, given the right learning framework","<p>How many pupils in your class would you define as “higher ability”? A single stand-out student? A handful of brilliant minds? Half the class – or even all of them?</p>

<p>Teachers’ answers will differ enormously. But according to the work of researcher Deborah Eyre, the answer from most teachers should be along the lines of: “All of them, potentially.”</p>

<p>Professor Eyre has developed a theory called “high-performance learning”. It states that many pupils are capable of achieving the high levels of academic success that are often seen as only attainable by the few, and that a school’s job is to make this vision a reality.</p>

<p>Since September, she’s been putting that theory into action in state schools for the first time.</p>

<p>Getting to this point has been an interesting journey for Eyre. She has specialised in working with high-attaining pupils since the early days of her career in the 1970s when, as a twentysomething primary school teacher in a leafy part of Maidenhead, Berkshire, she was asked to take responsibility for the most-able students throughout her school.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>'High-perfomance learning says you don't lower the bar for 20 per of students because three of them can't get there'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“It was an unheard of role,” she recalls.</p>

<p>During the 1980s and 1990s, Eyre led an Oxfordshire-wide programme to help schools to develop their most able pupils, and in the late 1990s she became an academic researcher investigating high performance in schools at Oxford Brookes University.</p>

<p>By the turn of the millennium, when the Blair government was turning its attention to this field, she was well placed to take a prominent role in its work: she became a leading figure in its “gifted and talented” programme, heading up the National Academy for Gifted and Talented Youth, a government programme set up in 2002 to identify the most-able pupils and give them extra support to excel at school.</p>

<h2><font color=""41AD49"">Paradigm shift</font></h2>

<p>Her latest thinking about high performance turns the orthodoxy of the Blair years on its head. Back then, says Eyre, the fashion was for a concept called the “cohort paradigm” – the idea that you could pick out a limited cohort of gifted pupils and support them to excel. She no longer believes in this. Instead, she thinks that those opportunities – and the high expectations that come with them – should apply to everybody.</p>

<p>“What was going right [during the Blair years] was, we learned a lot more about what advanced learning should look like and how to make it routinely available,” she explains.</p>

<p>“What was wrong was that the government was obsessive about identification… Therefore, even though your average teacher understood more about what advanced learning looked like, they weren’t always making it available beyond the cohort in question.”</p>

<p>This was bad for social mobility, believes Eyre. “We know from research across the world that cohort approaches, no matter how hard you try, are always inequitable,” she says. “You will be under-representing students from disadvantaged families.”</p>

<p>Her latest thinking is far more ambitious.</p>

<p>“In theory, what we know from psychology and neuroscience is that almost everybody could be getting their A* at GCSE,” she claims. “In practice, that’s unlikely because there are a load of barriers that individuals face in terms of making progress, but the job for schools is to remove as many of those barriers as possible, rather than thinking only a proportion of them are going to do well.”</p>

<p>This is a theory that she first mooted in 2011. “More pupils than we previously thought have the potential to perform at the highest levels,” she wrote in a report that year for thinktank Policy Exchange, called <em>Room at the Top</em>.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><img height=""844"" width=""1500"" class=""media-element file-preview img-responsive"" typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""http://tes.com/sites/default/files/styles/media_thumbnail/public/tes100317_40_inline.jpg?itok=VGmOlcZw"" alt="""" title="""" /></p>

<p> </p>

<p>“The way to secure this is to create a system that expects significantly more from more pupils.”</p>

<p>Since then, she has been working towards practical applications for making this work. Her research is based on studying the traits of successful learners and instilling those traits in all pupils. Eyre has identified a set of “cognitive competencies” that all pupils should develop, including perseverance, resilience, and the ability to think logically and critically, to solve complex problems, to have an open mind and to work collaboratively.</p>

<p>Eyre has also developed a framework from which school leaders can work to create high-performance pedagogy. This consists of seven pillars: mindset shift; enquiry-based learning; expertise development; practice and training; feedback; engagement of parents; and acting ‘with’ students, not doing ‘to’ them.</p>

<p>She has come to the conclusion that there is no single fixed model for schools to implement this framework. “In your school, you’ll know best how to do it,” she says.</p>

<p>Eyre now runs a commercial business called High Performance Learning to help schools find that bespoke approach.</p>

<p>In one example of a school she has worked with, teachers wanted to instil perseverance into nursery pupils. To achieve this, they made medals labelled “perseverance”.</p>

<p>“If a child persevered for a sustained period, they got to wear the medal and the teacher would send a picture of it to their parents, saying, ‘great example of perseverance’,” she explains. “It means the parents also know that the school values perseverance, so if a child can’t get their coat on very fast in the mornings, rather than intervening immediately, the parent will let them grapple a bit.”</p>

<h2><font color=""41AD49"">‘This is for everybody’</font></h2>

<p>Since September, Eyre has been working with eight schools on implementation of the framework: two grammar schools, two comprehensives, a primary and three international all-through schools.</p>

<p>This marks a major shift from the schools she first worked with on practical applications of her research: her previous test bed was between 2010 and 2014 through her role as education director of Nord Anglia Education, which runs international private day and boarding schools.</p>

<p>Sceptical teachers at British state schools might argue that it’s much easier to believe all pupils could excel at those schools than in their own, tougher context. Eyre admits that this would be a reasonable challenge, but that it would be wrong to restrict her work to elite schools.</p>

<p>“I field tested it in quite a benign environment and now I’m field testing it in some other environments which are much less benign,” she says. “The alternative is, this is only something for people in very advantaged areas. I don’t think that’s a thing we should be doing. This is for everybody.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>'Almost everybody could be getting their A* at GCSE'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is too soon to have conclusive results from the pilot schools, but what’s clear so far is that schools must be flexible.</p>

<p>Eyre says that at one of the pilot schools, a default stance of entering all pupils for triple science GCSE had been watered down because, for a small handful of pupils, this was too much. The school had then, for practical reasons, created a whole class to take the less demanding double science qualification, representing 20 per cent of the year group. Eyre’s approach suggests that the school should rethink this.</p>

<p>“High-performance learning says you don’t lower the bar for 20 per cent of students because three of them can’t get there,” she says. “What you do is think, how can we help those [three] students to get there, or put in other arrangements for them.”</p>

<p>The work so far has not always been easy, she says, because it requires schools to rethink long-established ways of doing things. However, she insists: “We have to try because the benefits of it being successful are huge.”</p>

<p>This also means that I’ve been lucky enough to do a bit of on-the-job training myself. My role has seen me flit from department to department, work in different teams, overview schemes of work to see where I can effectively embed English and liaise with all manner of people from all manner of backgrounds.

<p>Linux coding, grouting preparation, effective voice projection, self-defence techniques, the best point to release the ball for a jump shot, the best-value cuts of beef that are often overlooked – these are the things I’ve learned about both in sessions and in casual conversations. Working in an FE college is like accessing the human version of Google search, only it’s better because you can nick a biscuit out of their tin. There’s ample opportunity to learn something new if you’re open to it.</p>

<p>Practical experience is an invaluable tool when teaching any subject, but even more so when that subject is a vocational one. It means that there is an authenticity that learners respond to, an ability to instinctively and reflexively answer questions or demonstrate solutions, to call on lived wisdom to deal with the issues of the present. FE has it in droves – we should make sure that there continues to be an appreciation of it in the sector. Firstly, it would always be of benefit to our learners and, secondly, it means that I would continue to have help in upgrading computers, scoring a couple more baskets and making a delicious, homemade casserole with beef shin (cheap and melts in the mouth, according to Gary in catering).</p>

343256,CBI: Six ways to improve the apprenticeship levy,A more flexible skills levy and greater collaboration with the Institute for Apprenticeships: here are the CBI's recommendations for the future of the apprenticeship levy,"<p>“Significant concerns” still surround <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-news/apprenticeship-levy-what-new-guidance-reveals"">the apprenticeship levy</a>'s potential<strong> </strong>to<strong> </strong>deliver high-quality training for businesses and apprentices, the CBI has warned.</p>

<p>On the day that the levy was launched, the business lobbying organisation has said that the government needs to “broaden” its focus to make it a success. ""[The government's] focus so far has been on building an operational system that works,"" the CBI said in a statement. ""Now the policy has been introduced...the government [needs] to broaden its focus, prioritising quality and long-term success measures alongside growing apprentice numbers.""</p>

<p>The CBI said that major concerns still surrounded the apprenticeship levy, including slow progress in approving new apprenticeship standards, and ineffective careers guidance in schools, and it has drawn up a list of six recommendations for government.</p>

<h2><strong>Six ways to improve the apprenticeship levy</strong></h2>

<ol>
	<li>The establishment long-term measures of success by the <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-news/institute-apprenticeships-board-members-announced"">Institute for Apprenticeships</a> (IfA), agreed in partnership with businesses.</li>
	<li>Support the IfA and help it to understand what quality training looks like for businesses.</li>
	<li>Support collaboration between the IfA and businesses to help improve market regulation of college and private providers and challenge poor quality provision.</li>
	<li>Focus on increasing the pace of approval of new apprenticeship standards across all industries.</li>
	<li>Give employers longer than 24 months to spend their levy vouchers.</li>
	<li>Consider a more flexible skills levy to support apprentices and retrain adults.</li>
</ol>

<p><a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-news/sector-welcomes-apprenticeship-funding-u-turn"">Neil Carberry, director for people and skills policy at the CBI</a>, said: “Given the speed and scale of the introduction of the apprenticeship levy, businesses have been working hard to get ready against a tight timescale. Now that the system for paying and reclaiming the levy has gone live, the time has come to focus on quality training that meets company and apprentice needs.</p>

<p>“For the levy to be a success, it must deliver long-lasting careers, and close skills gaps – not just create more apprenticeships. Shifting the focus on to quality is essential to delivering much-needed stability to England’s skills system. That’s why business is focused on helping the IfA get this right. As it stands, there is a genuine risk that firms aren’t going to be able to use their funds if the system does not deliver the training apprentices need.”</p>

<p>A spokesperson from the Department for Education said: “We want to build a world-class education and skills system that will give everyone a chance to climb the ladder of opportunity to rewarding careers.</p>

<p>“Quality is at the heart of our reforms. That is why we have given employers more freedom than ever before to design training that works for them and ensure it delivers the skills and knowledge that our economy needs. We have been working closely with employer bodies, including the CBI, to help them and their members prepare to make the most of the opportunities available.”</p>

<h2><strong>'An apprenticeship and skills nation'</strong></h2>

<p>The DfE has said that the levy will ""double the annual investment in apprenticeships in England to £2.5 billion by 2019-20, compared with 2010-11 levels"".</p>

<p>Apprenticeships and skills minister Robert Halfon said:<b> ""</b>More than 90 per cent of apprentices go into work or further training, and the quality on-the-job training on offer will make sure we have the people with the skills, knowledge and technical excellence to drive our country forward. Building an 'apprenticeship and skills nation' is essential in ensuring that we have the home-grown workforce we need in post-Brexit Britain to address the skills shortages facing industry and give everyone the chance to succeed.”</p>

343334,We have three months to tell the DfE what’s going wrong,The government has opened two primary consultations – and it’s up to us to make our concerns heard,"<p>And so, it has finally arrived. We were promised the consultation on primary assessment “early in the new year”, and they managed it within the first quarter of the year. We have another three months to ruminate now on the merits of the proposals put forward by the department for improving the current dog’s breakfast that is primary assessment.</p>

<p>To give the department its due, it’s not bad. There is much to recommend in <a href=""http://bit.ly/PrimaryConsult"">the two new consultations,</a> not least the openness of some of the questions. It’s a far cry from the nonsense of the consultation in 2013, much of which was promptly ignored. This time, the department appears to have learned some lessons and is prepared to hear what teachers really think. Perhaps after getting their fingers burned more than once over the past few years, the current secretary of state has been persuaded that teachers might actually know what they’re talking about.</p>

<p>Not for the first time, I am urging primary teachers – in fact, any teachers – up and down the country to respond to the consultations so that the DfE gets clear messages about what we want to see. We need to be realistic: suggesting that we just scrap all accountability will get your response regarded as nonsense (and rightly so, frankly), but we can make sure that we give sound practical advice about how to make things better, including for pupils with special educational needs.</p>

<p>Early years experts should be clamouring to contribute to the debate about what a robust and reliable baseline might look like, both in terms of content and implementation. There will be plenty of others who want to have their say but many of them – including me – don’t know early years like some do. They might also want to take the opportunity to claim a future stake for the role of the foundation stage profile as a broader recognition of learning in the early years.</p>

<h2><font color=""00B5E2"">Fixing the system</font></h2>

<p>Colleagues in infant/junior and first/middle schools will have a keen interest in addressing the needs of those specific schools. It’s clear that the current system of key stage 1 assessments is not functioning well and causes many issues in the sector; perhaps some localities have worked out better ways to ensure consistency of measures across schools that allow children to benefit.</p>

<p>Teachers in primary schools ought to be looking closely at the breadth of proposals, considering the implications of removing the KS1 tests, reducing the burden of statutory teacher assessment, but also introducing the new multiplication tables check in Year 4. We should also take the opportunity that the consultation provides in question 20 to set out ways in which we think workload can be reduced. There are few opportunities to feed so directly into such discussions at a national level.</p>

<p>Those of us teaching in Year 6 will be keen to see improvements to the frameworks for assessment at age 11, not least to the nonsense of the teacher assessment of writing. The department seems open to recommendations in this area – clearly recognising that the current mess isn’t working – and this time it seems to realise that teachers are best placed to advise.</p>

<p>Like with so much of democracy, if we don’t take our opportunities to have our say, then we diminish our entitlement to complain about the outcomes. The DfE seems open to guidance on fixing the system we have at the moment. Let’s make sure it hears clearly from teachers exactly what can be done to make assessment work better for schools and their pupils.</p>

343625,"'In our current system, exams are about the outcome, rather than the learning that gets to them'","With all manner of after school, before school and holiday revision sessions being run, do we send the message that pupils' aggregated effort over two years is more important than in the last two weeks?
","<p>It's a few months until the <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/gcse"">GCSE exams</a> start. You’re teaching Year 11. You ask them how they are feeling about their exams and the first answer you get is: “Well, I’ve got plenty of time to revise”.</p>

<p>In fact, said students are spending more time thinking about the time when they will revise than what they are currently doing. Perhaps the teacher is, too.</p>

<p>There seems to be a reliance on this vague conflation of revision and learning.</p>

<p>Having one eye on the exam timetable is part and parcel of teaching. But, owing to the high stakes pressure, it brings out – at best – some cold sweats or – at worst – some unnatural and unhelpful pedagogical changes, ranging from rushed teaching to “I'm going to let them get on with some revision in this lesson while I review our departmental revision resources”.</p>

<p>The problem is that while students seem to have dangerous misconceptions about <a href=""https://www.tes.com/revision-tips/rethinking-revision-its-more-just-facts"">what revision actually is</a>, for teachers, their own students' obsession with the term has perhaps led some to forget that cramming, after-school revision sessions and all those interventions with Year 11 in the last few months are not as impactful as a whole range of other things, even in the closing weeks of the GCSE course.</p>

<p>I’ve been as guilty of this as anyone.</p>

<p>In the past, I have introduced an intensive timetable of additional lessons and revision sessions in the lead up to the exams for Year 11. The aim of which was to go over the bits that I felt students didn’t have the best handle on.</p>

<p>When planning these sessions, I realised in my heart of hearts that some of it I simply hadn’t taught that well. Granted, in some cases this was due to intense time constraints – trying to power through reams of content. Instead of saying “I’m going to teach this one topic extremely well even if it means I don’t cover the other two in time”, I went for the “I’m going to skim teach all three of these topics”.</p>

<p>“Whirlwind teaching”, as I would describe it, isn’t about learning. It’s about ticking necessary boxes and did little for my students.</p>

<p>I knew some of them were lost, but I persisted because I believed they needed to cover that content in some way, any way, just as I believed that <a href=""https://www.tes.com/revision-tips/revision-technique-quality-not-quantity"">all manner of after-school, before-school and holiday revision sessions</a> were necessary and effective. The reality of the last being that there was little differential in the final results between those who had attended all the revision sessions and those that hadn’t.</p>

<p>In fact, there may have even been a negative differential one year.</p>

<p>This whole thing with revision sessions reminds me of my Spanish lessons here in Spain. I turned up for the first few months religiously every week at 5pm, but because of a combination of tiredness and my lack of language-learning ability, I switched off for part of each session.</p>

<p>Better than nothing? Maybe. But a tick in the box of language learning? Probably not.</p>

<p>And this is the same for some students, who, for the sake of appeasing mummy and daddy, <a href=""https://www.tes.com/revision-tips/how-motivate-all-your-students-revise"">turn up to every revision session</a> but are more interested in chatting to their mates or daydreaming.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, poor Mrs Muggins has spent an hour or so planning the session, resourcing it and delivering it at the end of an already tiring day. She drives home with the sincere but misguided notion that Johnny will get a better result because of his attendance.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, she gets back too tired and too late to mark the Year 11 books and to plan adequately for the following day's lesson.</p>

<p>And so, the cycle of tickbox revision goes on, perhaps to the detriment of quality teaching or quality assessment.</p>

<p>For the students, the message is clear: revision sessions will save you, as long as you attend.</p>

<p>So, for those students of a lazy disposition, their default position is sometimes to do nothing until the revision sessions start and then attend every one of them.</p>

<p>If schools say they aren’t running them, from the outset, how would that impact Year 11 pupils' attitude towards the exam season?</p>

<p>Do we send the message that learning is a process that happens over the course of two years, not two months?</p>

<p>Do we send the message that their aggregated effort over two years is more important than in the last two weeks? Sometimes, I'm not sure we do.  </p>

<p>I sometimes worry that in our current system, exams are about the outcome rather than the learning. Funnily enough, this has ended up being to the detriment of both.</p>

<p>From my personal experience, these are the things I feel have been successful in ensuring that students pass exams:</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> <b>Quality teaching</b></p>

<p>Ensuring that when content is first introduced, it's done so in the best way possible. The lesson or series of <a href=""https://www.tes.com/revision-tips/english-literature-revision-made-easy"">lessons digs deeper into the topic</a> and doesn’t skim. Assessment within the lesson is given time and priority.</p>

<p><strong>2. </strong><b>Spacing</b></p>

<p>Returning to the same content in the form of a mini-quiz or short test every second or third lesson, then moving to every fifth or sixth lesson. Making sure that provision for knowledge consolidation is definite.</p>

<p><strong>3. </strong><b>Active revision</b></p>

<p>Ensuring that students know how to revise. It’s no good just reading notes. It’s important that students understand methods that give the best possible chance at knowledge retention in the shortest possible time.</p>

<p>These are often active methods that force students to do more. Games, quizzing and using flashcards fall into that bracket. It’s also worth noting, that when students teach each other, they retain the most amount of the information.</p>

<p><strong>4. </strong><a href=""https://www.tes.com/revision-tips/fail-safe-memory-recall-techniques-exam-students""><b>Exam skill practice</b></a></p>

<p>Students need to be ultra-familiar with the exam paper. Dawn Cox writes that her students would know how to answer questions on the exam way before learning the content for it, owing to concerted efforts to familiarise students with mark schemes and model answers. This needs to happen through the course, not as a “tag on” at the end.</p>

343994,'Why every state school should teach the Classics',"A head of humanities explains why his state school teaches the Classics ─ and why your school should, too","<p>Now is the time to stand up for the Classics in our secondary schools. Budget cuts and accountability measures have all taken their toll on this intriguing subject of late, but I believe that every state school should allow their students the opportunity to study the wonders of the <a href=""http://www.tes.com/news/school-news/classics"">ancient world</a>.</p>

<p>Here are five reasons why I think that all schools should offer Classics:</p>

<h3><strong>1. The range of characters</strong></h3>

<p>Caligula, Xerxes, Ovid, Socrates...the Classical world has it all, from heroes and villains to all shades in between. Students will be fascinated by the range of characters they will encounter, many of whom are prototypes for character types they will encounter in modern literature and film today. Studying Classics will give students the chance to delve into the psyches of some of the most infamous figures of the ancient world and shatter the old clichés of incest, excess and needless brutality that the Classics are known for. </p>

<h3><strong>2. Similarities with the modern world</strong></h3>

<p>It is easy to dismiss the ancient world as an irrelevance. Yet Athens was the cradle of democracy and Sparta was where the quest for human physical perfection began. Only recently, one of my students was making the link between the Athenian demagogues of the late 5th century BC, and the recent rise of populism in the USA.</p>

<h3><strong>3. Giving students thinking space</strong></h3>

<p>We all know that studying <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/history"">history</a> is supposed to encourage critical thinking, but how often do we read the same essay trotting out all the causes of Hitler’s rise to power? The ancient world is characterised as much by what we don’t know, as what we do. This gives students much more space to develop and express their own opinions and come up with some really perceptive ideas.</p>

<h3><strong>4. Avoiding the 'male, pale and stale'</strong></h3>

<p>Let’s face it, modern history topics are dominated by men. Teaching the Classics will give you a chance to introduce your students to a fascinating cast of powerful women from antiquity. From Agrippina’s malevolent manoeuvrings to get Nero to the top of the pile, to Olympia convincing her son Alexander the Great that he really was a God, your students will have a chance to look beyond the usual male-dominated view of history.</p>

<h3><strong>5. Helping your school’s results</strong></h3>

<p>With curriculums being squeezed by financial constraints and Progress 8 demands, the ancient world can help. From September 2017, OCR’s <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/gcse"">GCSE</a> Ancient History specification is EBacc accredited, so your SLT will be on board with it.</p>

344153,A day in the life of…Stuart Ratcliffe,"It may take a while to navigate the Jakarta traffic, but this teacher in Indonesia is greeted by well-behaved and motivated students – and some tasty lunch options","<p>My day starts early, at 5am. I teach at an international school in West Jakarta, and lessons start at 7.15. Being up before the sun is something you get used to in Indonesia.</p>

<p>I spent four months here during my gap year before I started university and fell in love with the country. As soon as I graduated, I headed straight back and have been here ever since. Indonesia is a melting pot of vibrant cultures and is home to the friendliest people in the world.</p>

<p>After a quick cold shower, my partner and I are out of our house and on the road by 6am. The Jakarta traffic is notorious for a reason, and if we leave 10 minutes later, it can add an extra hour onto our journey.</p>

<p>After a brief car ride, I complete my journey on an <em>ojek</em>, a kind of taxi where you hitch a ride on the back of someone else’s bike. It can be problematic in the rainy season, but it is undoubtedly the quickest way to travel in Indonesia.</p>

<p>I arrive at school by 6.30, grab a quick coffee at a nearby 7-Eleven, and head into my school. The humidity and heat is oppressive, even at this early time, and I am glad to get into the air-conditioning of the building. The teachers at my school are a mix of expatriates, mostly from the Philippines, China, India, Singapore, Australia and America, but there are also local Indonesian teachers here too. As a result, the staffroom is colourful blend of languages and cultures.</p>

<p>My school uses the CIE curriculum, and I teach English and history IGCSE. English is the first language used in school, although students also learn Mandarin and Bahasa Indonesia (the official language of Indonesia). I have around 35 teaching periods of 30 minutes each per week, as well as other projects and co-curricular activities. Class sizes at our school range from around 20 to as low as 4; we are a small school by international standards, with only about 70 secondary students. We also have a primary and pre-primary division in our campus, meaning that shouts of excitement coming from the younger years are a constant background noise to my lessons.</p>

<h2><font color=""00C7B1"">Many students go on to university abroad</font></h2>

<p>Most of our students are from middle-class families, and they pay around 80 million IDR (£4,000) per year in tuition fees to attend our school. Many will go to university abroad, in the US or Australia.</p>

<p>Indonesian students are polite and diligent, and classroom management is rarely an issue. Most are highly motivated and academic, and many go on to achieve excellent IGCSE and A-level results. We are encouraged to use student-based teaching pedagogies, but when exams are looming, we are often forced into exam drilling. The high tuition fee puts real pressure on us to get results.</p>

<p>For lunch, I usually go to a nearby <em>warung</em> (cafe) and have something like <em>nasi campur</em> (rice, chicken, tofu, a fried egg and vegetables). Lessons end at 3.30pm, but it is rare that I leave the school then; on a good day, I am home by 6pm.</p>

<p>In the run-up to the IGCSEs we have classes from 4-6pm, and on Saturday mornings as well. It can be a gruelling stretch of lessons and marking, but the lengthy holidays (one month in the summer, and one month at Christmas) is more than ample reimbursement.</p>

<p>On Fridays, I play futsal (a game similar to football) with colleagues after school, before heading to one of Jakarta’s many drinking establishments. But most nights, I head straight home, exhausted, and am in bed by 9pm.</p>

344306,"‘For just a few days this Easter, dear teachers, please step away from the workload’","Please, please, please try to forget the feckless parents, digitally-addled teenagers, new GCSE grades, funding crises and the rest, writes one celebrated head","<p>One thing I’ve learned recently about writing and blogging on education: if you want to be widely quoted and vigorously retweeted, make a strong traditionalist statement. And if possible, sound exceedingly grumpy about it.</p>

<p>I should know. A couple of weekends ago <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/letting-teenagers-start-late-routine-something-they-have-learn-deal"">my Tes column applauded recent research debunking the idea of delaying the start of the school day in order to accommodate teenagers’ sleep habits</a>. Okay, so my advice to youngsters took the tone, “That’s life. Deal with it!”, but I wasn’t actually irritable.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, my piece was accompanied by a stock picture of me looking uncharacteristically miserable (see above), and the piece gained a fair bit of traction.</p>

<h2>Testing the theory</h2>

<p>I thought it would be amusing to see what the senior end of my school thought of the idea in an assembly on the following Monday morning. I based my homily on the presumption that at least half of them, being teenagers, would naturally be in sympathy with the idea of starting later.</p>

<p>But hardly a hand went up when I asked they question. I should be gratified, I guess, that they’re apparently so keen to get to school: but it wrecked a talk (not my most inspired one, I confess), which was designed to be relatively challenging on the topic but still light-hearted.</p>

<p>The Chairman of the Independent Schools Council, Barnaby Lenon (a former Headmaster of Harrow School) fared better in many ways when interviewed about his forthcoming book, <em>Much Promise</em>. In it, he apparently castigates dads who want to be their son’s best friend instead of instilling discipline and structure in their life.</p>

<p>Boys should also spend less time on their digital devices, according to another quote from the book. In response, Neil Roskilly (General Secretary of the Independent Schools Association) mischievously tweeted: “My 10-year-old has just emailed me to say he disagrees [with Lenon]”.</p>

<p>This comment reminded me that wrongful use of devices by youngsters is not an entirely new thing. One afternoon some 16 years ago, if I calculate correctly, I received a text at about 2.45pm. It was from my younger daughter, enquiring when I was taking her home that day.</p>

<p>I replied giving a time, and then enquired, “How come you’re texting? Aren’t you in a lesson?”</p>

<p>“Yeah”, came the response. “But it’s only maths. And it’s boring.”</p>

<p>It wouldn’t be so bad, I guess, but for the fact that I was the head of her school. Still, the story ends well: she ultimately became a teacher.</p>

<h2>Here comes the fun?</h2>

<p>So, for this week, you’ll get no sermons from me on the importance of good quality sleep, nor of early bedtimes and early rising. Nor another criticism of swingeing government cuts, nor yet of all the other perils and pressures facing schools up and down the country.</p>

<p>We’re well into April, and even the hardier schools (including mine) have finally finished term. And none are quite back to it either.</p>

<p>So for a few days, dear colleagues, forget about feckless parents, digitally-addicted teenagers, new GCSE grades and funding crises. Get some sun, get some rest, and have a good one!</p>

","<p>One thing I’ve learned recently about writing and blogging on education: if you want to be widely quoted and vigorously retweeted, make a strong traditionalist statement. And if possible, sound exceedingly grumpy about it.</p>

<p>I should know. A couple of weekends ago <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/letting-teenagers-start-late-routine-something-they-have-learn-deal"">my Tes column applauded recent research debunking the idea of delaying the start of</a>...</p>",2017-04-13 15:23:00,/sites/default/files/news_article_images/bernard_3.jpg,/sites/default/files/bernard_1_6.jpg,,Breaking views,School news,"Pay and conditions, Workload",3007,"344036, 344006, 340958, 340952",publish
344852,"Phonics leads to easier, more accurate, reading, new research finds",Linking symbols to sounds helped adults learn to read unfamiliar scripts,"<p>Learning to read through phonics leads to more accurate reading aloud and comprehension than focusing on whole words, new research reveals.</p>

<p>Researchers from Royal Holloway, University of London, tested the effectiveness of phonics by training adults to read in a new language, printed in unfamiliar symbols, and then measured their learning with reading tests and brain scans.</p>

<p>They found that people who are taught the meanings of whole words did not have any better reading comprehension skills than those who are primarily taught using phonics, and that those taught using phonics were better at reading aloud.</p>

<h2>'Brains had to work harder'</h2>

<p>They also found that the brains of adults who had learnt to decipher the symbols by a whole-words method had to work harder when they read, compared to the brains of people using phonics.</p>

<p>Professor Kathy Rastle, head of the psychology department at Royal Holloway, said: ""The results were striking; people who had focused on the meanings of the new words were much less accurate in reading aloud and comprehension than those who had used phonics, and our MRI scans revealed that their brains had to work harder to decipher what they were reading”.</p>

<p>There has been a major push to introduce phonics into English schools. Phonics is part of the National Curriculum and a phonics check is taken by pupils at the end of Year 1.</p>

<p>The check involves pupils reading aloud 40 words, including 20 non-words, to their teacher.</p>

<p>In 2016, 81 per cent of pupils reached the expected standard of 32 correct words <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/poorer-pupils-fall-further-behind-5-things-we-learnt-todays-ks1""><strong>in the phonics check</strong></a>, up from 77 per cent in 2015.</p>

<p>But there has been concern that the focus on phonics may not help all children - particularly <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/phonics-not-best-way-helping-older-readers-study-finds""><strong>older readers</strong></a> who are struggling and <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/focus-phonics-excludes-send-children-discussion-literacy-charity""><strong>children with special educational needs</strong></a>.</p>

<h2>Old claims disproved</h2>

<p>“There is a long history of debate over which method, or mix of methods, should be used to teach reading,” Professor Rastle said.</p>

<p>“Some people continue to advocate using a variety of meaning-based cues, such as pictures and sentence context, to guess the meanings of words.</p>

<p>""However, our research is clear that reading instruction that focuses on teaching the relationship between spelling and sound is most effective. Phonics works.”</p>

<p>Dr Jo Taylor, also of Royal Holloway, carried out the research with Professor Rastle. She said: “People frequently argue that phonics disadvantages reading comprehension. Our work puts that claim to rest. Phonics actually enables reading comprehension by relating visual symbols to spoken language.</p>

<p>""The laboratory method that we’ve developed in this study offers strong evidence for the effectiveness of phonics, and has also helped us to understand why phonics works, in terms of the brain systems responsible for reading”. </p>

<p>Nick Gibb, the Schools Standards Minister, said: “This research highlights the potential benefits of learning to decode using phonics.</p>

<p>""Thanks to the hard work of teachers, our continued focus on raising standards and our increased emphasis on phonics‎, there are now 147,000 more six-year-olds on track to becoming fluent readers than in 2012.”</p>

<p>The research was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council. The paper. <em>Comparing and validating methods of reading instruction using behavioural and neural findings in an artificial orthography, </em>was published today in the  <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology: General</em> </p>

345053,Ofqual rules out rationing top grades for bright pupils taking 'hard' subjects,But the exams watchdog will adjust grade standards this summer to make it easier for more A-level students to achieve top grades in languages,"<p>Ofqual has ruled out making changes that could have rationed the number of A and A* grades awarded in subjects attracting the brightest pupils.</p>

<p>The exams watchdog's decision today follows more than a year of public discussion and debate on a <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/ofqual-considers-gcse-and-a-level-overhaul-could-ration-top-grades"">series of measures proposed by Ofqual </a>to improve the comparability of grades across GCSE and <a href=""http://www.tes.com/news/level"">A-level</a> subjects. </p>

<p>It said it will not try to align grade standards across the full range of GCSE and A-level subjects as the challenges are too great.</p>

<h2>One-off measures in 'compelling' cases</h2>

<p>One of the proposals Ofqual had considered was ensuring that the same proportion of students would gain each grade in every subject to make exam results in ""hard"" and ""easy"" subjects more easily comparable.</p>

<p>Currently, some subjects such as further maths, classics and physics see a much higher proportion of pupils receive top grades than others, including design and technology, computing and drama.   </p>

<p>But today Ofqual said it will ""not try to take co-ordinated action to align grade standards across the full range of GCSE or A level subjects"" as there were too many challenges in measuring how subjects may compare.</p>

<p>The exams regulator did say, however, that it will consider making one-off adjustments to standards in subjects where there is a ""compelling case"". </p>

<p>For example, it has already begun conversations with subject communities in relation to A-levels in physics, chemistry and biology, as well as modern foreign languages. </p>

<p>But Ofqual did announce that it will ensure standards are set appropriately for French, German and Spanish at A-level <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inter-subject-comparability-2015-to-2016#attachment_2073066"">after new research</a> concluded that awarding should take into account the fact that native language speakers take these subjects.</p>

<h2>'Grade standards should be comparable'</h2>

<p>The research was conducted in response to concerns that the proportion of native speakers sitting A-level MFL is rising and that, as a result, students are being disadvantaged due to the methods via which standards are maintained.</p>

<main id=""content"" lang=""en"" role=""main"">
<p>The adjustment to grade standards, which will be decided in the summer, could lead to ""small increases"" in the proportion of A-level MFL students getting top grades if the ability of the cohorts remain the same as previous years. </p>
</main>

<p>Sally Collier, chief regulator of Ofqual, said: ""Everybody expects that grade standards between exam boards in any particular subject should be comparable.</p>

<p>""However, inter-subject comparability is more difficult to consider. We are extremely grateful to the stakeholders who have offered their opinions and the many researchers who have helped us reach our policy decision.</p>

<p>""Combined with the actions we are taking this summer specifically in relation to A level languages, it will mean we are better placed than ever to ensure standards in GCSEs, AS and A levels are appropriate.""</p>

345349,The education research plan: 7 key questions answered,Is the government’s new research strategy for Scottish education a good move?,"<p>In the newly published Research Strategy for Scottish Education, the government has hinted that there might be another independent review of Curriculum for Excellence after the new qualifications are “bedded in”.</p>

<p>Here, we look at what else the new research strategy says and the circumstances that led to its introduction.</p>

<h2><font color=""ED3340"">What is the Scottish government research strategy?</font></h2>

<p>The strategy was promised in the education delivery plan published by education secretary John Swinney last June, shortly after he took over the education brief.</p>

<p>The plan said that the strategy would be published by December 2016 and would make clear “any gaps in our evidence base and how these gaps will be filled”.</p>

<h2><font color=""ED3340"">What prompted Mr Swinney to make that particular commitment?</font></h2>

<p>There has been a lot of criticism from academics of the Scottish government’s use of research in education.</p>

<p>In particular, the Royal Society of Edinburgh’s education committee hit out at the government in its submission to the OECD review of Curriculum for Excellence in 2015, saying the Scottish government failed to undertake pilot studies, collect baseline data or make early plans to effectively assess whether the reforms were working.</p>

<p>The society also accused the government of failing to maintain “the former high quality of empirical research into Scottish education” by cutting funding.</p>

<h2><font color=""ED3340"">Is anyone else unhappy with the Scottish government's use of evidence to inform education policy?</font></h2>

<p>Opposition politicians took the government to task for not knowing enough about how well pupils were doing in primary. That prompted first minister Nicola Sturgeon to admit she did not know enough and commit to introducing the standardised assessments in literacy and numeracy, due to come in next year.</p>

<p>But because standardised testing was being introduced, the government scrapped the Scottish Survey of Literacy and Numeracy – as revealed in Tes Scotland – prompting another onslaught of criticism.</p>

<h2><font color=""ED3340"">What does the research strategy reveal about the government's plans?</font></h2>

<p>There is a hint that the government might commission a review of the senior phase of Curriculum for Excellence. The 2015 OECD review of CfE focused on the broad general education up to S3, and the strategy states: “The option was also left open to have a further review of the senior phase of CfE at a point in the future when the new national qualifications were bedded in.”</p>

<p>The government also says that it will “maintain a watching brief” over whether it should consider joining major international education surveys like those it pulled out of in 2010. Michael Russell, who was education secretary at that time, pulled out of Pirls (Progress in International Reading Literacy Study) and Timss (Trends in International Maths and Science Survey), saying that the move would save £800,000 and reduce the bureaucratic burden on headteachers – but the action was attacked by academics.</p>

<p>The research strategy also talks about exploring the possibility of introducing new ways of identifying disadvantaged pupils at the “individual-level”, as opposed to by the area in which they live. It acknowledges that the majority of disadvantaged pupils do not live in deprived areas.</p>

<h2><font color=""ED3340"">How will the new standardised assessments be used?</font></h2>

<p>The standardised assessments in literacy and numeracy – due to be sat in P1, P4, P7 and S3 – form one part of the national improvement framework, which has been introduced to monitor the performance of the system. It was published for the first time in December and will be published annually.</p>

<h2><font color=""ED3340"">Are there any other attempts to improve the use of evidence in education?</font></h2>

<p>The government has also entered into a partnership with the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) to produce a Scottish version of the charity’s teaching and learning toolkit, which attempts to sum up what the research says about the strategies that work when it comes to closing the attainment gap and how cost-effective they are.</p>

<p>It also talks, in the new research strategy, about further developing another online tool aimed at helping heads spend the £120 million earmarked for disadvantaged pupils.</p>

<p>However, academics have been largely disappointed with the quality of the projects highlighted on the Interventions for Equity site, saying that they were underpinned by too little evidence.</p>

<h2><font color=""ED3340"">The strategy was late: was it worth it?</font></h2>

<p>Some – namely opposition politicians – see this as closing the stable door after the horse has bolted, arguing a research strategy should have been in place from the moment Curriculum for Excellence was introduced.</p>

<p>Academics, meanwhile, have welcomed the fact that a research strategy has been produced, but say many questions remain unanswered – not least whether or not researchers will have access to the data generated by the new standardised assessments.</p>

345445,College chiefs get pay rises – as staff wages are frozen,‘Embarrassment for the sector’: most college leaders enjoyed a pay boost last year,"<p>More than half of college leaders received a salary increase last year – at the same time as their staff were subject to a pay freeze, new figures suggest.</p>

<p>The Association of Colleges’ refusal to offer a pay rise on behalf of its member colleges in 2015-16 led to national strikes involving two unions. But analysis of new data published by the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) reveals that, in the same year, almost 60 per cent of colleges increased their spending on pay for their principal or CEO.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://bit.ly/CollBoss"">the ESFA data</a>, 12 colleges paid their leaders £200,000 or more this year – up by 50 per cent from the previous year.</p>

<p>And with the figures for 11 colleges missing from the data – including Birmingham Metropolitan College, which paid CEO Andrew Cleaves £260,000 the previous year – the total number could rise further.</p>

<h2><font color=""F26522"">Significant trends</font></h2>

<p>The figures for some institutions cover periods during which they underwent changes in leadership and overlap between principals, as well as one-off bonuses. While the college accounts published by the ESFA are incomplete, they do highlight significant trends in college leader remuneration. Around one-fifth of colleges spent the same amount on their leaders’ pay as in 2014-15, with a similar proportion spending less.</p>

<p>Andrew Harden, head of further education at the University and College Union, says: “College leaders who tell staff that the money is not there for a fair pay rise – all while pocketing massive pay rises themselves – are an embarrassment to the sector.”</p>

<p>He adds that the figures “shine a light on the seemingly arbitrary nature of pay at the top in further education”, and calls for greater scrutiny: “With college mergers on the horizon, there may be some senior managers who think this is an ideal time to increase their own pay packets.”</p>

<h2><font color=""F26522"">'Competitive' salaries</font></h2>

<p>Analysis of CEO pay levels, however, reveals that college leaders tended to receive significantly less than their counterparts in other parts of the education sector.</p>

<p>James Croft, executive director of the Centre for the Study of Market Reform of Education, says that if colleges want to attract “talented, experienced, and committed people”, they “have to be able to make a strong and competitive offer”.</p>

<p>“In fact, comparing education executives’ pay to similarly skilled professionals in other sectors – and properly relating it to the degree of responsibility involved – it appears obvious we should be paying our executives even more than we do now,” he adds.</p>

<p>Top of the pay table was Cornwall College Group, where former CEO Amarjit Basi received £404,000 during 2015-16.</p>

<p>The college says this included a one-off payment of £204,000 in lieu of notice and other contractual obligations when he left the organisation in July 2016.</p>

<p>The payment came after he was urged by the UCU to “reassess” his salary as a “supportive” message to staff under threat, after it emerged that up to 60 members were at risk of redundancy.</p>

<p>According to the ESFA, the institution (along with Birmingham Metropolitan College) is currently undergoing intervention due to concerns over its finances.</p>

<p>Mr Basi also came in for criticism in a 2015 report by the FE commissioner on his previous employer, New College Nottingham, which cited “the expansionist policy of the previous principal, which involved diversification into a number of unprofitable non-core activities” as a “key” reason behind its financial difficulties.</p>

<p>Mr Basi was contacted for comment.</p>

346006,Why MATs are doubling schools’ inspection burden,Ofsted warns that internal inspections are an ‘unacceptable waste of staff time and pupil funding’,"<p>When Ruth Coombs’ academy went into special measures, she knew that this would mean termly visits from Ofsted.</p>

<p>What the deputy headteacher did not realise was that it would also mean a second set of termly inspections, with even higher stakes. These were conducted by Oasis Community Learning, the academy chain to which Coombs’ school belonged.</p>

<p>“Sometimes an Ofsted visit felt easy in comparison,” Coombs (not her real name) says. “Oasis are your employers, so you want to do a good job for them – prove all the things you’re putting in place are having an impact.</p>

<p>“We felt we needed to prove that we were moving things forwards. Otherwise they’d start looking at the senior leadership team, and ultimately it was my job at risk.”</p>

<p>Most multi-academy trusts (MATs) now run internal inspections of their schools, according to Russell Hobby, general secretary of the NAHT headteachers’ union. “MATs have a duty to understand what’s going on in their schools,” he says.</p>

<p>“Schools wouldn’t want them to go on raw data alone. But how welcome inspections are probably depends on how they’re operated.”</p>

<p>And how they are operated varies considerably between academy chains. Some MATs conduct formal inspections, following the Ofsted framework; others limit the inspection to little more than an informal chat between the headteacher and MAT executives.</p>

<p>But Ofsted is clear that internal inspections are “an unnecessary waste of teachers’ time”.</p>

<p>Ark, one of the larger MATs, sends one or two Ofsted-trained inspectors – either retired or freelancing on the side – into each of its 35 schools every year. They are accompanied by one or two members of the Ark executive.</p>

<p>Each school completes an Ofsted-style self-evaluation form before the inspection. The Ark inspectors then talk to senior leaders, middle management and pupils. They also observe lessons, before drawing up a series of targets for the school.</p>

<p>“We bring in HMIs [senior Ofsted inspectors] because they provide us with a helpful external perspective,” says Brian Sims, Ark’s director of education.</p>

<p>“I know that there can be a culture of high-stakes inspections. But we don’t use them for high-stakes decisions about personnel and management.”</p>

<p>At Reach2, the largest primary-only MAT in the country, internal inspections are carried out by senior leaders from Reach2 schools, supported by an external consultant.</p>

<p>They are conducted roughly a term before an Ofsted inspection is due, and follow the watchdog’s framework, with an emphasis on leadership, management and pupil progress.</p>

<p>A Reach2 spokesperson said: “This approach allows schools to be confident during an Ofsted inspection and provides a great development opportunity for our school leaders.”</p>

<p>Some smaller MATs, however, conduct less formal inspections. The Samuel Ward Academy Trust, in East Anglia, brings all its headteachers to each of its 15 schools for a day, and uses the inspection as a staff development exercise.</p>

<h2><font color=""ED3340"">'It shouldn't be happening'</font></h2>

<p>Naomi Shrimpton, headteacher of Heathlands Primary Academy in Bournemouth, has weekly visits from the school improvement adviser of Ocean Learning Trust, the four-primary MAT to which her school belongs.</p>

<p>“But the chief executive’s office is on my site,” she says. “So I see him almost daily. He’ll say, ‘I’ve seen this happening at one of the other schools – do you want to try that?’ It’s definitely a partnership; a supporting process, rather than a critical eye.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Academies Enterprise Trust (AET), a 66-academy trust, does not conduct internal inspections at all. But the chain is not prepared to say why.</p>

<p>Mary Bousted, general secretary of the ATL teaching union, would prefer all MATs to follow AET’s example. “Internal inspections stress teachers out,” she says. “Ofsted’s bad enough. But, if you recreate Ofsted within your own MAT, it becomes incredibly stressed and it takes the focus away from teaching and learning. It’s bad practice, it’s increasing workload, and it shouldn’t be happening.”</p>

<p>Ofsted chief inspector Amanda Spielman has also criticised the practice of carrying out internal inspections, either alongside or in preparation for the watchdog’s visit.</p>

<p>Speaking at the Association of School and College Leaders annual conference earlier this spring, Spielman said: “When school finances are under pressure and workloads are high, running ‘mocksteds’ is an unacceptable waste of staff time and scarce pupil funding.”</p>

<p>Ofsted has made it clear this concern applies to inspections run by MATs as well as schools.</p>

<p>Ruth Coombs saw first-hand the duplication caused by dual inspections. “Generally speaking, Ofsted and Oasis were saying the same things,” she says.</p>

346045,Teach your pupils the art of coding,"Coding is part of the curriculum now, but why do we have to treat it as a technical subject when children think of it as a creative endeavour, asks Christian Darkin","<p>""I can’t teach coding – the kids are better at it than I am.”</p>

<p>It’s a complaint that I hear a lot when I visit primary schools to talk about writing, coding and animation.</p>

<p>This look of horror crosses the faces of teachers, who feel that coding is right at the edge of their expertise.</p>

<p>They’re often only teaching it because they “get” the subject a little more than everyone else in the staffroom – and because, well, the curriculum says it’s got to be taught. But they don’t feel comfortable, and they rarely feel they’re completely on top of the subject.</p>

<p>At its heart, this is a problem not with coding but with our attitude – the way that we think about coding. Coding, we surmise, is about computers. It’s about numbers, and calculations, and thinking logically. Coding is a science, and it should be taught like a science.</p>

<p>But coding is not a science. It’s about logical procedures and the automation of linking one event to another, certainly.</p>

<p>But it’s all done in the pursuit of creative rather than technical aims.</p>

<p>Part of my work is as an animator. I make cartoons and movie special effects. To do that, I use all the tools of coding. But I don’t use them like a scientist. I use them like an artist.</p>

<p>Coding is just a different media in the arts. It’s the same as sketching or writing. It’s about building a story and communicating it through a medium. Just like learning to paint, or use grammar, it requires a few technical skills, but is it not really about those skills.</p>

<h2><font color=""512984"">Pupils can express themselves</font></h2>

<p>That’s certainly how the children are thinking about it. They don’t see designing a videogame as a technical job. They see it as a creative project. They’re excited by it because it allows them to express their individual ideas. They learn the maths of coordinates not because they’re interested in geometry, but because moving a Pac-Man around a maze requires that skill.</p>

<p>Why does this matter? It matters because teaching science is about knowing more than the pupils and helping them to discover what you already know. If you stand up in a science or a maths lesson and the kids know things you don’t, then that’s scary.</p>

<p>But in art, it’s different. If you’re an arts teacher, a music teacher, an English teacher, and your student produces an idea that you wouldn’t have thought of in a million years, you don’t feel intimidated.</p>

<p>You feel proud of them. You go to the staff room thinking you’ve done a good job because you’ve enabled someone to access their own genius.</p>

<p>An arts teacher doesn’t feel they have to be better than their students at every aspect of what they’re teaching. The creative teacher’s job is to recognise skill. It’s to know what’s easy and what’s challenging for their pupils, and ask them the questions that will enable them to stretch themselves.</p>

<p>Of course, you can’t teach the next Van Gogh without knowing a bit about painting, but you don’t have to be better than Van Gogh. You just have to recognise his genius, show him how the paints work and point him at the subjects that are going to inspire him and move his art forward.</p>

<p>Working this way does mean a bit more chaos in the computer room. Pupils will be working at different speeds, and some will end up producing work that is vastly different from others. Pupils will swap ideas and use each other’s techniques as much as yours, like a noisy art class – but that’s okay. As long as you know where each child is, and which questions will stretch their own projects.</p>

<p>Just as in an art class, some children will be better at different media. In coding, some will be interested in programming the mechanics of a game, while others may be more driven by developing a cartoon’s story or drawing the individual frames that make a movement. It’s all good, because it’s all creative, and it all makes children actively want to solve the technical stuff to make their ideas work.</p>

346228,Unions threaten action against academy chain over staff cuts,Eight unions will go to Acas with the David Ross Education Trust after breakdown of talks over planned support staff cuts,"<p>Eight unions have written to a Multi-Academy Trust warning of “possible action” if it goes ahead with plans to axe support staff.</p>

<p>The David Ross Educational Trust (DRET), which runs schools in the East Midlands and Yorkshire and Humberside, has been issued with a “final warning” from the unions after the failure to reach an agreement over proposed cuts.</p>

<p>Talks will now take place at conciliation service Acas.</p>

<p>According to unions, the chain is proposing to cut nearly £1 million from school budgets and up to 40 jobs across its 32 primary and secondary schools.</p>

<p>The eight unions involved are Unison, GMB, Unite, the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), NAHT, NASUWT, the NUT and the ATL. They have written to the chain’s founder, David Ross, urging him to put the planned cuts on hold.</p>

<p>According to the unions, the trust has already increased the amount it charges schools to provide central services such as payroll and IT.</p>

<p>Unison’s head of education, Jon Richards, said: “Academies were meant to give schools more control, yet across the DRET chain, headteachers, parents and staff have been misled.</p>

<p>“Vital jobs will be lost, extra work created, pupils disrupted and overworked staff put under even greater pressure.”</p>

<p>Kevin Courtney, general secretary of the NUT, said: “It’s essential the academy trust does not go ahead with its proposal but opens up constructive talks with unions at the earliest possible opportunity.”</p>

<p>Geoff Barton, ASCL’s general secretary, said the unions had “no alternative to issue this formal written warning” in response to “unacceptable decisions and inadequate communication emanating from the DRET”.</p>

<p>Russell Hobby, general secretary of NAHT, said his members were “concerned about the detrimental impact these proposals could have for both safeguarding and health and safety in the schools in this trust”.</p>

<p>In a statement DRET said: “The Trust has been developing proposals to look at how we can better use the expertise of our administration staff to enhance classroom learning across our network.</p>

<p>“The education sector as a whole is facing financial pressures, so it is right that we utilise the skills of staff  to ensure that our students continue to make significant progress and our academies get positively recognised by Ofsted.</p>

<p>“We have engaged with the Unions for a very significant period of time over these plans. Up until recently, this relationship has been productive and positive, and we are surprised that they have chosen to adopt a different approach over recent weeks.</p>

<p>“The Trust has already contacted ACAS to try and resolve the issues that the Unions are raising, and we look forward to meeting  Union and ACAS representatives at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<p>""We want to stress that from our extensive consultation with staff, the majority have been very understanding, and appreciate that our desire to improve education outcomes are at the heart of the proposals. They also see that there will be the opportunity for talented staff to take on positions with greater pay and responsibility.""</p>

The London college will formally join NCG in August, following agreement by the governors of both institutions and endorsement by the London area review. </p>

<p>In January, NCG announced its <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-news/carlisle-college-join-ncg"">merger with Carlisle College</a>, which means the group is now made up of five colleges – Carlisle College, Kidderminster College, Newcastle College, Newcastle Sixth Form College and West Lancashire College – and two training providers, Intraining and Rathbone Training.</p>

<h3>Second largest FE institution</h3>

<p>According to the latest available data from college accounts, <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-news/revealed-uks-largest-college-groups"">revealed by <em>Tes </em>today,</a> NCG is currently the second biggest FE institution in the country, with its income following the merger with Carlisle College estimated at £145.6 million. The merger with Lewisham Southwark College could take that up to £176 million – only £11 million less than the annual income of the LTE Group, the country's biggest college group in 2015-16.</p>

<p>NCG chief executive Joe Docherty said: “We look forward to supporting Lewisham Southwark College in their drive to improve the quality of education and skills provision in these two critically important London boroughs, which will bring benefits to the students, employers and other stakeholders in central south London.” </p>

<h3>'We will continue to determine our own curriculum'</h3>

<p>Lewisham Southwark College principal Carole Kitching said the merger would provide “a catalyst for growth in the range of programmes we can offer students, including vocational and technical higher education”. “All five of <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-news/ncg-rated-good-ofsted-after-four-month-wait"">NCG's colleges have been recently rated Ofsted ‘good’</a>, and as one of the largest providers of apprenticeships in the country we can work together to offer employers locally a unique opportunity to engage with a single provider to meet their national training needs.”</p>

<p>She added: “We will continue to determine our own curriculum in response to local need, with NCG’s full backing for growth and development. The college will maintain a high degree of autonomy through the powers delegated to a local college board.”</p>

347263,Seven ways to bring extra money into your school,"With many facing funding issues, now is the time for communities to rally around their schools. This head of media gives her advice on how to encourage this support","<p>The school funding crisis is in full swing. The reality is hitting home that subjects, staffing and resources are all experiencing a massive squeeze. However, while we protest and campaign for political parties to stick to their manifesto pledges, the education of our young people must go on.</p>

<p>It might be prudent at this point to reflect on the emphasis African cultures place on family and community and the relevance of this timeless Igbo and Yoruba proverb: “It takes a village to raise a child”</p>

<p>While the squeeze takes place, it is more important than ever for the UK community to rally around its local school and its local children. It is vital that parents, local councils, local businesses all come on board as a collective and help financially to educate the children in their ‘village.’</p>

<p>As teachers, managers and senior leaders, we cannot expect people to simply gift us money; we must be creative, bold and ask for the funds we need. Securing funds from grants has become ever more vital and competitive.</p>

<p>Here are seven tips to start you off that I have found quite useful:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Break down all your projects into small amounts</strong><br />
	Whether the project is worth a total of £100 or £30,000, break it down into manageable chunks of cash that can be pledged.<br />
	 </li>
	<li><strong>Match projects to relevant local businesses</strong><br />
	Create a list of businesses in your catchment area and find out what they do in the community already and what their aims are in terms of their public profile. Sometimes your school's project could provide just the type of public image the business would like to associate itself with.<br />
	 </li>
	<li><strong>Call on the parents in your school who have links with the local, county or national business community</strong><br />
	Network with these parents; they can be an invaluable network for contacting the right managers or even CEOs.<br />
	 </li>
	<li><strong>Look at all the funding sites and read their guidelines carefully for eligibility and criteria</strong><br />
	Hunt out grants and take note of what each funding pot is looking to award money for. Take note of the deadlines. Tes provides a <a href=""https://www.tes.com/content/leadership-plus"">grants database </a>with its leadership subscription. <br />
	 </li>
	<li><strong>Start local</strong><br />
	Make contact with your local councilors and ask what local funding might be available to your school area and your project. I tend to look at grants and funding sites relevant to my borough and county first and then look at the grants being issued nationally. <a href=""https://www.princes-trust.org.uk/help-for-young-people/who-else/employment/grants-funding/community-projects"">The Prince's Trust</a> has a very helpful website with a list of organisations offering funding.<br />
	 </li>
	<li><strong>Pitch</strong><br />
	Albert Einstein is reported as saying: “If you can’t explain it, you don’t understand it well enough.” If asked to pitch to potential funders, aim to sum it up in three lines. One of the biggest problems that prevents a school getting funding is that the idea is there, but the pitch is vague on how it will be delivered and for whom. Be clear in your application on your objectives, how you intend to deliver these objectives, costings and timeframe.<br />
	 </li>
	<li><strong>Be brave, bold and relentless </strong><br />
	Our children’s education need the collective support more than ever, so don't give up at the first hurdle.</li>

347521,Is it farewell to the prime of Ms Jo Brighouse?,"As she moves on to the next step in her career, our columnist wonders if she’s leaving her golden age of teaching","<p>Stood on the stage, whipped cream covering my face and the sound of cheering ringing in my ears, I realised how much I was going to miss the place. </p>

<p>I’m not sure it is customary to bid farewell to departing primary teachers with public humiliation and custard pies, but this was no ordinary primary school. In what was obviously the head’s personal staff retention policy, any outgoing employee was invited up onto the stage in their final assembly to participate in a leaving ceremony. Which, in this instance, consisted of a set of physical challenges involving buckets, hoops, whipped cream and a finale that my HR friend assures me is borderline sexual harassment in the workplace. </p>

<p>Leaving after just a few short years was never my plan but Mr Brighouse (in his wisdom) had acquired a new job 90 miles from home and – once we’d ruled out both long-term commuting and divorce – we found ourselves left with only one option.  </p>

<p>But handing in my notice wasn’t easy. There was so much I loved about this school. Staff were implicitly trusted; nobody demanded planning in triplicate: marking and assessment policies were designed to be effective without being overly time consuming and teachers were valued for ability, not malleability or cheapness. Add to this a dedication to SEND and inclusion and a job-share partner to die for and it was simply the loveliest place to work. And, as these things tend to do, it filtered down. </p>

<p>Results and standards were high, not just on paper, but in reality. The children were happy – the school gave them confidence and experiences that went above and beyond any curriculum. More than one teacher from the local secondary commented on their resilience and independence. </p>

<p>Now I’ve left it behind, I’m wondering if that was my golden age of teaching: the prime of Ms Jo Brighouse. Of course the very nature of golden ages means it’s hard to spot when you’re in one. I imagine there were people in the Renaissance lamenting a time when art was taken seriously and inhabitants of 1940s Hollywood who longed for the good old days when film stars really were stars.  </p>

<p>In the future, we’ll probably say that the golden age of teaching was any that involved glue sticks and class sizes under 40, but if this was mine, I really didn’t expect to find it in an era where testing, micro-management and endless top-down reforms bestride education like a Colossus; where teachers flee 60-hour-weeks and endless judgement. </p>

<p>For now, I’m back in a limbo of form filling and smiling blandly at the supply agency girl as she assures me all their schools are “fabulous places to work”. </p>

<p>I have no idea if any schools are ready and willing to extend the golden age of a middle-aged teacher (who may or may not be in her prime). If not, I’d probably settle for one with glue sticks – and class sizes under 40. </p>

347587,How to compete when your neighbours select,"Could ‘grammar streams’ help non-selective schools to hold their own? For two secondaries, the scheme is already seeing off the challenge of their rivals…","<p>In less than a month’s time, ministers will have a mandate to introduce new grammar schools across the country – if opinion polls are anywhere near accurate.</p>

<p>Some secondaries will have to adjust as a neighbour starts to cream off the most academically able pupils in the area.</p>

<p>Last week, Sir Michael Wilshaw, Ofsted’s former chief inspector, told Tes he was unconvinced that comprehensive schools near to grammar schools – effectively secondary moderns – would be able to overcome the challenges of selection. “They will be seen as a second-rate school,” he warned.</p>

<p>But two “comprehensives” tucked away in the quiet residential streets of Bournemouth, only a couple of miles down the road from two grammar schools, are determined to challenge this view.</p>

<p>Glenmoor and Winton academies – a girls’ school and a boys’ school sharing the same site and staff – offer a more optimistic vision of the future. Last year they outperformed their academically selective neighbours on the government’s Progress 8 measure.</p>

<p>And the academies’ executive principal, Ben Antell, says that a growing number of pupils who pass the 11-plus exam are choosing to attend his non-selective schools, rather than the grammar schools in Bournemouth and Poole.</p>

<p>One reason, he says, is the academies’ “grammar stream” for academically able students – offering a more academic programme alongside tailored advice on careers and universities and compulsory music tuition. It was launched two years’ ago as an alternative to the area’s binary selective system.</p>

<p>Deborah Hawkins, assistant principal at the academies, says: “Parents see it as a healthier environment for their children. Grammar school doesn’t necessarily mean that children have the best teachers or best opportunities for enrichment.”</p>

<p>The grammar stream is one of a number of initiatives introduced at both academies in the past seven years to turn around the public perception of the schools and transform their culture.</p>

<p>In 2010, the boys’ school, then called Winton Arts and Media College, was put into special measures.</p>

<p>“The behaviour was poor,” Antell, who was a middle leader at the time, says. Calm and ordered students would step out of a lesson, go down the corridor and cause “chaos”.</p>

<p>Ofsted’s damning verdict brought about the introduction of a zero-tolerance policy to disruption, which is still in place today at the academies. If a teacher has to ask a child to stop “slowing the learning” more than once, including swinging on a chair or fiddling with a pen, then the student is sent to an isolation room for 24 hours.</p>

<p>The United Learning (UL) academy chain, which the schools joined in 2013, is considering adopting a similar behaviour policy across all of its schools after seeing the positive impact in Bournemouth.</p>

<p>“It needs a brave school to do it because it caused controversy,” Antell says. “Parents really applaud the behaviour system until their son or daughter are involved in it, and then they are not so keen.”</p>

<h2><font color=""ED3340"">Turning things around</font></h2>

<p>But the schools – which are now both rated as good by Ofsted – have seen a significant rise in results. Last year, 70 per cent of Glenmoor GCSE students achieved at least five A*-C grades including English and maths, compared to 54 per cent in 2015.</p>

<p>And Winton – the boys’ school, which is now oversubscribed – did even better, with 74 per cent of students achieving the GCSE benchmark, compared to 55 per cent in 2015.</p>

<p>This is not the only trend that the Bournemouth academies are bucking. Wilshaw repeatedly raised concerns about the quality of education in coastal areas when leading Ofsted. But Antell argues that his nonselective coastal secondaries are doing as well as some of the top comprehensives in London after he adopted initiatives pioneered in schools in the capital.</p>

<p>For example, both Bournemouth schools now use a rank order system – which Dame Sally Coates, one of UL’s directors, first introduced to turn around Burlington Danes Academy in London.</p>

<p>Students are ranked for each subject twice a year and receive their results in an envelope. The order is displayed publically on a board – but only the top performers in each subject are named.</p>

<p>“It feels like a Year 11’s results day when they get their rank order results,” Antell says. “You see lots of happy and delighted children. And you also see some disappointed children. I have had tears.”</p>

<h2><font color=""ED3340"">Streams become reality</font></h2>

<p>The system is used to track progress, identify whether interventions are needed and hold teachers to account for their results, Antell adds. More recently, it has been used to judge whether students should be moved in and out of the grammar stream each year.</p>

<p>Currently, students who have passed the 11-plus but choose the schools automatically gain a place when they join. Other pupils sit a test in Year 6 for entry to the stream. But space is left to allow greater flexibility, Hawkins says. “Some 11-year-olds aren’t ready and don’t have a parent pushing them.”</p>

<p>Jude Di Verdi didn’t take the grammar stream test in Year 6. He only transferred in to the stream in Year 8 after demonstrating his academic ability, but is now determined to stay.</p>

<p>He contrasts the flexibility he benefitted from at Winton with the rigidity of the local 11-plus. “You don’t get another chance to go to Bournemouth School [a grammar school for boys]. You’ve missed out if you don’t apply before Year 7.”</p>

<p>Rank order enables the school to track whether able students are coasting. For example, half of the Year 7 boys in the stream didn’t get in the top 30 mid-year – but once this was highlighted, nearly all of them were back in top 30 by the end of the year.</p>

<p>“They really care about rank order,” says Hawkins. “We talk about how we value hard work more than talent. It’s a really important life lesson for them.”</p>

<p>The NUT teaching union revealed last month that it was considering legal action against grammar streams (see <a href=""http://bit.ly/grammarstream"">bit.ly/grammarstream</a>).</p>

<p>However, the Bournemouth academies seem unlikely to be targeted by the union, as it made a distinction between streams that were permanent and those where pupils could move in and out.</p>

<p>As far as Wilshaw is concerned, nonselective schools should have introduced grammar streams “a long time ago”.</p>

<p>But despite significant changes to his academies, Antell admits there are still parents who perceive both schools as secondary moderns.</p>

<p>“I have worked hard to arrest that concept,” he says.“There are a core number of parents who chase the grammar school dream. There is still this perception in Bournemouth [of] everything else being second best.”</p>

348247,England is a ray of hope in a gloomy education nation,"With just a fortnight to go before polling day, two teachers on opposite sides of the political fence declare for the party they believe has schools’ best interests at heart. Here, Jonathan Porter urges you to choose the Conservatives","<p>If you want to see how to ruin a once-proud education system, you don’t need to look far. Only to Scotland, in fact.</p>

<p>For about a decade now, Scotland’s devolved government has overseen plummeting educational standards. Earlier this month, the Scottish National Party (SNP) government published the results of the latest Scottish Survey of Literacy and Numeracy. They show a sharp decline in reading results on top of already weak numeracy results the year before.</p>

<p>The Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) results are no better. Whereas in the past, Scotland could justifiably have looked down on England’s lacklustre schools, now it’s the other way round. English pupils (still mediocre internationally) are increasingly pulling ahead of their peers across the border.</p>

<p>All of this provides a compelling counter-factual. At the same time as policymakers in England have placed more power in the hands of teachers and school leaders, a controlling Scottish government has centralised education policy, empowering fewer and fewer people who actually teach. It explains why Scotland’s hubristically named Curriculum for Excellence has been such a flop: its futuristic “skills-centred” phantasmagoria (soon to be rolled out in Wales) is totally at odds with what we teachers know about how children actually learn.</p>

<p>Daniel Willingham sets out the reasons for this in the most important book that wasn’t on your teacher-training course: Why Don’t Students Like School. In it, Willingham makes clear that it’s subject-specific knowledge that begets skills. Ask a chemist to think critically about the causes of combustion and they’ll do so with gusto. Ask them to think critically about the causes of the Franco-Prussian War and their critical-thinking faculties may quickly depart.</p>

<h2>Ticking the box</h2>

<p>And this, in a nutshell, is why – whisper it – many teachers will be ticking the Tory box in three weeks’ time. They probably won’t dare tell comrades in the staffroom but they know that the Conservative-led reforms since 2010 make England the best place to be educated in the UK.</p>

<p>Academies and free schools are giving greater autonomy to the people who really know what’s best for our children’s education – our teachers. Unlike in Scotland, headteachers in England can choose who they want to employ and how much they should be paid. Academies and free schools now mean that it’s easier than ever before for failing schools to be passed on to more exacting management.</p>

<p>New free schools, with effective accountability, can be Petri dishes for innovation and new ideas. Twitter and the blogosphere crackle and pop with the sound of contested opinion like never before.</p>

<p>Deep down we know that the old curriculum wasn’t good enough for our children. We knew we worked hard, but we weren’t duped into thinking that standards were rising just because pupils’ GCSE grades were going up. The Labour Party may have doubled education funding but we know that its largesse had little discernible effect on standards. As education professor Rob Coe put it when faced with the data, “The best I think we can say is that, overall, there probably has not been much change”.</p>

<p>Those of us who suffered through them know that part of the reason for this was that the GCSE “equivalents” were nothing of the sort. Gone are “nail technology” and “study skills”, but for the unfortunate few. In are maths, science, history and a language for the many.</p>

<p>Gone, too, is the panoply of inspectors, local authority advisers and consultants hawking their wares – learning styles, Brain Gym, learning to learn – which sensible teachers always knew were hokum. English teachers today are freer than they have been in decades to teach in the way that they think best. Scottish and Welsh teachers still suffer under the yoke of “progressive” fads foisted on schools from – dare I say it – “experts” on high.</p>

<h2>Safeguarding reforms</h2>

<p>The Conservatives are right to aim for 75 per cent of pupils achieving the English Baccalaureate by the end of the next Parliament. We know that, if it were our child, we’d want them to be able to contribute to the great cut and thrust of mankind. To know why Darwin was drawn as an ape. To know Oliver from Thomas Cromwell. And to do better than their parents at ordering steak haché seven miles out of Calais.</p>

<p>Finally, we know that behaviour in Britain’s schools is still scandalously poor. And that you won’t hear that said by those who defend the status quo. Schools are always paradoxical in that way: the higher you get, the worse the view. The Great and the Good may choose to look the other way, but they can never say again that they did not know.</p>

<p>For the thousands of pupils and teachers in disrupted classrooms, a recognition of the continuing behaviour crisis in many of our classrooms can’t come soon enough. At least the Conservatives have recognised the burden this places on teachers, offering forgiveness on student loan repayments as a small token for those who continue teaching for their career.</p>

<p>And don’t, for a second, think that a few more grammar schools will change any of this. There’s enough to be done in the thousands of comprehensive schools we already have.</p>

<p>The truth is that only the Conservative Party can be relied on to safeguard the reforms of the past seven years. A commitment to a genuinely teacher-led profession, a knowledge-rich curriculum and good behaviour in classrooms will always be a priority for Conservatives in the way that it isn’t for our left-liberal friends.</p>

<p>We believe that it is teachers who are best placed to run our schools, that deep domain knowledge is what begets skills, and that behaviour in Britain’s schools urgently needs to get much, much better.</p>

","<p>If you want to see how to ruin a once-proud education system, you don’t need to look far. Only to Scotland, in fact.</p>

<p>For about a decade now, Scotland’s devolved government has overseen plummeting educational standards. Earlier this month, the Scottish National Party (SNP) government published the results of the latest Scottish Survey of Literacy and Numeracy. They show a sharp decline in reading results on top of already weak numeracy results the year before.</p>

348991,Political parties must make manifestos for young people,"It’s time for teenagers to be actively engaged with politics, parties to speak to them more and teachers to contribute their opinions","<p><img style=""width: 250px; height: 89px; float: left; margin: 5px;"" class=""media-element file-default img-responsive"" typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""http://tes.com/sites/default/files/election_countdown4smaller3.png"" width=""250"" height=""89"" alt="""" />We have all become immune to schools being asked to solve society’s ills. Terrorism? Introduce Prevent in schools to detect and defeat extremist tendencies. Obesity? Cyberbullying? Child sexual exploitation? The list is seemingly endless: you name it, the schools will fix it. Sorry, but I am about to add to the list. It’s politics you need to help us mend next. Consider.</p>

<p>Most of those reading this column will cast a vote on 8 June even if, on this occasion, there’s a touch of world-weary cynicism about the parlous state of our body politic. No, with a heavy heart, we’ll do our duty – in my case pointlessly, as I live three houses the wrong side of a border that separates a vulnerable Labour seat from my constituency, which has returned a Conservative since Gladstonian times.</p>

<p>There, I’ve revealed my party sympathies – which, as a teacher who later worked in local government, I was brought up never to do. From the 1970s there was a definition of “politically sensitive posts” which precluded the holders, including me, from engaging in party political activity. A bit like a monk’s vow of celibacy.</p>

<p>It was, and still is, much the same for teachers. We encouraged – schools still do – mock polls at the time of a general election, but party politics is prohibited territory for teachers, full of minefields.</p>

<p>I now think political abstinence by schools is a mistake that is undermining our society by creating a knowledge deficit and contributing to a sense of powerlessness among school leavers, which is the enemy of democracy itself.</p>

<h2>Political illiteracy</h2>

<p>Talking to friends of my teenage grandchildren, I am struck by what might be called their political illiteracy. It’s not just their alarming lack of knowledge of all but a few politicians: they don’t seem to know what an MP is or does, much less the distinction between central and local government powers. They are all at college or sixth-form or on apprenticeships – all in the generation swept up by the raising of the age of those in education to 18.</p>

<p>Their lack of knowledge, skill and judgement in political matters is more serious for their and our future than wrestling (often unsuccessfully) with equations or fronted adverbials.</p>

<p>What I am suggesting, therefore, is that part of the post-16 curriculum in schools and colleges should be a requirement that at national and local election times, all the political parties produce a manifesto summary aimed at 16 to 18-year-olds. The parties should be required to back their manifesto promises and proposed policies with evidence.</p>

<p>The prescribed format might require each party to set out how voting for them would impact on the present and future economic, physical, mental, and spiritual wellbeing of children, young people, employed and unemployed working-age people, disadvantaged and minority groups, pensioners, the environment and people in other countries.</p>

<p>Teachers should be encouraged to join in the hustings, where the party representatives would set out their stall. Such one-off election hustings and manifestos might be complemented by annual debates on key political issues of the moment.</p>

<p>After the turbulent last 12 months of the Brexit referendum, Trump and digitally-enabled “fake news” and “alternative facts”, in education we can no longer hide modestly behind the skirts of political celibacy. If politicians are assuming they can decide what we teach and how we teach it, we surely have a duty to help our young people – who at 16 can join the armed forces – to be better equipped and committed to vote and make political choices when they are 18.</p>

349021,Cash flow creativity,Colleges need to work innovatively and collaboratively if they are to increase their incomes and protect their futures,"<p>The college sector is under significant financial pressure. Despite that, we can reveal that the proportion of colleges planning with a deficit budget in 2017-18 has dropped significantly on this year.</p>

<p>This, the Association of Colleges says, is at least in part down to the sector experiencing a slightly more stable political environment – slightly less upheaval from government. But as we look towards the general election next week, it is far from guaranteed that will continue. The sector needs to safeguard against that and ensure it is financially as resilient as possible.</p>

<p>There are two ways to do this, of course. One is to cut costs – and that is a risky strategy. Staff are by far the highest cost factor of further education colleges, and reducing overheads is, in the words of one principal I spoke to this week, a “downward spiral” with “implications” for the quality of provision that a college can offer.</p>

<p>That leaves the second way for colleges to improve their finances: growing income. One way to do that, many in the sector assume, is through offering more apprenticeships. While that is undoubtedly true, how well colleges manage that will transpire over the coming months. The apprenticeship market is a competitive one.</p>

<p>So colleges cannot put all their eggs in the apprenticeships basket. They need to be creative and diversify their income. As much as they are in competition with each other, they will be able to do that more successfully if they share best practice and collaborate to boldly reach beyond the boundaries of FE</p>

350083,Four ways to teach scientific vocabulary at primary level,A primary science specialist shares her tips for helping children get to grips with the tricky vocabulary of science topics,"<p>Helping children to understand how to use a vast array of unfamiliar technical vocabulary is one of the many challenges of teaching <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/primary"">primary</a> science effectively.</p>

<p>Many words will be entirely new to children and some that are familiar will have different meanings to their everyday use — ""weight"", ""material"", ""diet"" and ""chemical"", to name a few.</p>

<p>How can we make this new and confusing vocabulary stick? A few small tweaks to the way you teach new <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/science"">scientific terminology</a> can make a big difference.</p>

<h3><strong>1. Teach actions alongside words</strong></h3>

<p>As any experienced <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/literacy"">phonics teacher</a> will tell you, teaching an action alongside a word helps to make it memorable. The main benefit of applying this technique when teaching scientific vocabulary is that the action can be associated with the meaning of the word. This means that each time the word is spoken alongside the action, children are getting a quick reminder of its meaning.</p>

<p>For example, the word ""precipitation"" could be accompanied by wiggling your fingers to indicate rain, while ""reflection"" could be a fist bouncing off an outstretched palm just as light bounces off objects. These actions will be even more memorable if the children have come up with them themselves (under your guidance, of course), and collecting ideas for new actions can provide a good assessment opportunity to see who understands different terms.</p>

<h3><strong>2. Add some detail to your displays</strong></h3>

<p>Science displays with topic vocabulary on colourful cards are a familiar sight in the primary classroom, but for the display to be of any use, children need more than just the words themselves. Words should be displayed with a definition that the class has come up with as they learnt the meaning of the word (again with some careful guidance), written out by a member of the class.</p>

<p>Even better, you could add a photo of a child carrying out the agreed action for each term alongside the word, or a drawing or diagram done by a child that illustrates the word.</p>

<h3><strong>3. Play with the words</strong></h3>

<p>Vocabulary games are generally low or no-prep activities which children will enjoy. Use scientific vocabulary that the class has already learned to play in games such as <em>Charades</em> or <em>I</em><em> Spy</em>.</p>

<p>One particular favourite of mine is a spin on the game <em>Articulate</em>, in which teams have to guess a word being described without using specified words related to it; for example, a child may have to get their team to guess the word skeleton without using the words ""bone"", ""skull"", ""support"" or ""body"". This is also another sneaky way of getting in some formative assessment.</p>

<h3><strong>4. Keep them around</strong></h3>

<p>It’s a good idea to keep a permanent reminder of vocabulary from past topics to hand, by creating your very own scientific dictionary. When you move on to a new science module and take down the old vocabulary display, put the display materials into a class book for future reference.</p>

<p>As you already have the materials ready, it is incredibly easy to make and will be a popular addition to your book corner because it contains the children’s own work.</p>

<p>Use a ring binder so that new entries can be filed alphabetically – an honour you could bestow on some eager scientists-in-training in your class. This class dictionary could even follow the class through school and be added to each year, giving children a very personal and relevant record of all the vocabulary they have learned throughout their time in primary school.</p>

351412,"'As I reach the end of my NQT year, I'm worried about how I will survive my career in teaching'","This NQT loves being in the classroom, but worries about how the negativity surrounding the profession will affect him in the long term","<p>Teaching is undoubtedly the most relaxing part of my day. There is nothing I like more than being in the classroom, inspiring young people and watching them learn.</p>

<p>Yet, as soon as the bell goes for the end of the lesson, I am filled with dread.</p>

<p>Tentatively, I approach my laptop to check my emails, worrying about what might lie in wait for me. Will there be a message from a parent complaining that I haven’t pushed their son or daughter far enough in <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/mathematics"">maths</a>? Will there be an unreasonable data-input target from my head of department? Or a memo to attend yet another after-school staff meeting that incorporates endless government-driven fallacies?</p>

<p>I am in the <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/nqts"">final term</a> of my NQT year and should be looking forward to a long and fruitful career in education. But I am more apprehensive than anything else. Don’t get me wrong, I am one of the first to extend my love for the profession. It is a cliché to say that teaching is the most rewarding job in the world, but I really believe this to be true.</p>

<h2>Negative mindsets</h2>

<p>The teaching isn’t the part that worries me. It is the sheer amount of negativity surrounding the profession. Having worked my way through the ranks as a sports assistant, teaching assistant and now NQT, I have seen some teachers succeed through sheer determination and passion, while others have burnt out and left the profession because of the weight of the expectations placed upon them.</p>

<p>I am worried that I will not be able to stay positive and that I will be one of those who buckles under the pressure. This is what makes me scared to open my laptop.</p>

<p>Until now, I have been lucky to have a fantastic mentor who advises me, challenges me and has supported me through some difficult times in my first year. He has taught me that our job is not our life, and our life should not be affected by our job – even though that seems to be the trend in this profession.</p>

<p>However, even with this support, I’m still worried. I’ve come to understand how very easy it is to be sucked into colleagues’ negative mindsets and habits. Without knowing it, they have an ability to control your happiness.</p>

<h2>Staying positive</h2>

<p>Teachers already face an insurmountable amount of negativity in the media. We are judged by parents, local education authorities, the government and by ourselves. The last thing a new teacher needs is for their day-to-day school life to be negatively affected by those who are supposed to be collectively supporting each other.</p>

<p>Next year, I hope that I am able to stay self-aware and enforce limits that will help me to step away from work when I need to. I know that the solution is to surround myself with pioneers in the staffroom – those colleagues who share a smile and who still know to have fun. They will be my best resource.</p>

<p>Then, if I open my inbox and find that it is filled with negative messages, I will know exactly where to turn.</p>

There is a profound lack of common sense in exam timetabling'","Pupil welfare and fairness for pupils who struggle to write have been given no consideration in the 2018 exam schedule, writes one school leader","<p>I rarely admit to a masochism, but must confess that I read the provisional GCSE timetable for summer 2018 as a way of bringing me back down to earth from the high of the previous evening’s <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/school-prom-rite-passage-or-ridiculous-american-import"">Year 11 prom</a>.</p>

<p>It certainly worked. I am dreading having to reveal to our Year 10 pupils the dastardly plans the exam chiefs have in store for them in 2018.</p>

<p>Who makes these schedules? Computers or people? Bureaucrats or educators? One glance at the schedule itself provides the answer.</p>

<p>Imagine the meeting: ""We’ve got two-and-a-half hours of English language scheduled for the morning of Friday 8 June. It will already have been a long week for Year 11, so shall we put something on in the afternoon that only a few thousand students will study, which is a short exam and which won’t have much writing?""</p>

<p>""No,"" booms a voice. ""What that slot needs is <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/long-agonising-wait-a-tsunami-exam-reform"">an exam for a new specification</a>, to be taken by as many pupils as possible with lots of writing so their hands, muscles and tendons are genuinely tested and exhausted. Let’s give them history unit 2."" And so they have.</p>

<p>Away from the corridors of examination power, 243,000 pitiable, voiceless and powerless history students groan in anguish at yet another <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/six-10-new-gcses-and-a-levels-remain-unapproved-just-18-weeks-term"">unnecessary examination stress</a>.</p>

<h2>'Wanton educational negligence'</h2>

<p>But why stop there? Not content with the upper cut and jab combination of language and history, the Joint Council for Qualification (JCQ) has managed some other blows: English and <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/a-year-change-geography"">geography</a> also appear on the same day – twice.</p>

<p>Perhaps the JCQ believes that some colouring in of coastlines will be relaxing after the morning’s English exam?</p>

<p>As a geographer myself, it seems rather odd that a government so hell-bent on pushing EBacc subjects is allowing the largest two humanities subjects to be examined on the same day as English three times. Surely they can see the impact that this will have on pupil performance?</p>

<p>Deliberately creating three exam days when pupils will sit two of the top ten most popular subjects by entry numbers seems an act of wanton educational negligence – or, one shudders to think, cruelty.</p>

<p>There are other days available with blank afternoon sessions, or ones with less than 10 per cent of the students involved. Pupil welfare and fairness for pupils who struggle to write have been given <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/tes-archive/tes-publication/cramming-exams-more-ways-one"">no consideration in this schedule</a>.</p>

<p>When was the last time any adult put pen to paper for three-and-a-half hours in a day? Even a one-paragraph pupil report leaves me aching these days. Please, JCQ, think of the pupils.</p>

<h2>Strange timing</h2>

<p>Of course, I have sympathy for the exam boards who have to create timetables for next year which build in the additional exam papers that the government feels our students need.</p>

<p>I fully appreciate that there are some days in the examination season that need to be <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/exams-brought-forward-accommodate-ramadan"">avoided for religious festivals</a>, but the lack of common sense is frightening.</p>

<p>One of my Year 10 pupils asked me why they couldn’t swap classics to make history follow maths, thus avoiding the writing marathon? I am proud of her logical thinking, but desperately sad that the professionals in charge cannot see the anxieties they are creating.</p>

<p><em>Nicholas Griffith is the head of Upper School at Liverpool College</em></p>

<p><strong><em>Responding to the piece above Michael Turner, director general of the Joing Council for Qualifactions writes: </em></strong></p>

<p>The article above makes the point that there is a profound lack of common sense in examination timetabling that disadvantages candidates.  The author asks who makes up these schedules.  ‘Computers, bureaucrats, people or educators?’  The answer is yes, computers, people, educators and administrators all contribute to the timetabling.</p>

<p>The Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ), on behalf of its awarding body members, publishes the common timetable for GCE and GCSE qualifications following a consultation each year running from February to April.  We consult with Teacher Associations and encourage schools and colleges to take part in the timetabling arrangements via our website. </p>

<p>Clearly, we want candidates to be able to show their best abilities in examinations and paramount in our timetabling is the aim of reducing, as far as possible, clashes in large entry subjects.  However, the examinations system in this country is substantial and complex involving over 15.4 million GCSE and A level examination scripts. In addition, additional papers now need to be timetabled due to the recent educational reforms.  Inevitably, there will be timetable clashes and it should be noted that the awarding bodies have procedures in place to support candidates who sit a number of examinations in a single day. </p>

<p>JCQ avoids ‘wanton educational negligence’ through its timetable consultations with teachers and their representative bodies to ensure as fair and equitable examination timetable for all candidates over the brief six week period as possible.</p>

<p>The next JCQ timetable consultation for the 2019 examinations season will take place from 28<sup>th</sup> February and run until 30 April 2018 and, as always, we welcome the views of teachers.     </p>

351853,"'Young people are striving to achieve educational equality, but politicians are not listening. Why?'","There are so many challenges in taking on educational inequality, but a good starting point would be recognising the voluntary work of many young activists","<p>This morning’s <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/no-prospect-gcse-gap-between-rich-and-poor-closing-warns-damning""><u>report from the Social Mobility Commission</u></a> made for depressing reading. The issue has been on the government agenda for decades but we have yet to see any real progress, especially with wages stagnating amid increases in the cost of living.</p>

<p>The report highlighted that, despite progress being made at primary level towards closing the attainment gap, at current rates it will still take 15 years before all children are school-ready by the age of five and 40 years before the attainment gap between the wealthiest children and those on free school meals at that age is closed.</p>

<p>At GCSE and A level, there is currently no prospect of the gap between <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/universal-free-school-meals-election-delivers-heads-and-teachers-yet"">free school meal</a> and non-free school meal children being eliminated. In higher education, it will take 80 years before the gap is eliminated. This is a huge issue for our whole society, particularly in the midst of Brexit negotiations, when nurturing ""homegrown"" talent will become ever more critical to our nation's prosperity.</p>

<p>Younger people are acutely aware of this, perhaps reflected in the historically high voter turn-out earlier this month. They understand their prospects are worse than those of their parents and they rightly want change.</p>

<p>There are many areas the government should be looking at to tackle this. But in particular, I don't believe that we will improve social mobility while we continue to live such segregated lives. The social media bubble is often referred to, but we live our daily lives in a bubble, too – although not necessarily through choice.</p>

<p>The recent terror attacks and Grenfell Tower fire saw an incredible response from communities and volunteers. Britain has a strong history of communities coming together in the wake of disasters to help each other – I sit on the board of the Royal Voluntary Service, formed as WRVS in response to the domestic challenges of World War Two.</p>

<p>However, it shouldn’t take such terrible events for people to reach out to each other and help those most in need. We need to do this on a daily basis, and to help this become the norm there need to be opportunities to give back at all ages, stages and settings.</p>

<h2>A helping hand</h2>

<p>One example is giving young people the opportunity to make the transition from education to employment through giving their time to their local community, instead of perhaps going abroad. The charity I head up, <a href=""https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/37b3BuVQA6c8?domain=cityyear.org.uk""><u>City Year UK</u></a>, engages dedicated and altruistic young people to volunteer full-time for a year in schools in some of the most disadvantaged communities in the country.</p>

<p>They make a huge difference to the pupils and, by serving as mentors, role models and tutors, the young volunteers themselves develop the leadership and resilience needed to continue to tackle the UK’s pressing social issues.</p>

<p>We are calling on the government to introduce legal recognition for those young people who volunteer full-time, as they are currently classified as NEET (Not in Education, Employment or Training) – not a great way for their country to recognise their contribution.</p>

<p>I strongly believe that more full-time volunteering opportunities, open to all, and with structured support for volunteers, can play an increasing role in breaking down barriers between communities and make significant impact on pressing issues.</p>

<p>We’ve found that pupils in primary and secondary schools who receive mentoring and near-peer support improve their academic attainment, behaviour and future outlook. And the young people who give their time gain experience, skills and career prospects in the process.</p>

<p>The government’s review of full-time social action will present its findings later this year, and I really hope to see legal recognition for full-time volunteers as one of the recommendations.</p>

<p>Overall, the third sector has an important role to play through engaging people, particularly 18-24-year-olds, who are more likely than older generations to engage in volunteering – building on community ties, bridging social capital and playing their part in addressing the challenges outlined in today's social mobility report.</p>

352210,Four questions to ask yourself about classroom innovation,"Innovation is crucial to improving practice, but teachers must approach new ideas with a pinch of salt, says one head of English","<p>I earned my magpie badge pretty early in my career. Like many new teachers, I was attracted to every shiny teaching idea I happened upon (which, in my pre-Twitter days, was less often than now) and was all too eager to try them in my classroom. My attraction to these sparkly innovations was positively reinforced by the praise I received from those observing my lessons and, at the time, there was an unquenchable thirst for the new.</p>

<p>It may not be surprising, then, that I was predisposed to <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/our-obsession-jargon-and-fads-we-have-forgotten-what-great-teaching"">falling down the rabbit hole</a> of using Brain Gym in my lessons. Not only was it shiny and innovative but I was easily seduced by the idea because it sounded, well, sciencey. Partway through my lessons, like the Green Goddess but with less lycra, I’d get my students up out of their seats to follow my lead with a variety of exercises that included such things as drawing sideways figures of eight in the air with our fingers. I was essentially distracting my students from their learning.</p>

<p>There’s always a risk to bringing something new into the classroom – it might fail and be a complete waste of time. However, there’s also a risk with just sticking with what we know: stagnation. The best thing we can do is be critical about innovations and <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/trust-your-own-judgement-improve-pupils-progress"">evaluate the impact of what we’re doing in the classroom</a>.</p>

<p>I’d recommend asking these four questions when you come across a shiny new idea:</p>

<h3><strong>1. How sound is the evidence? </strong></h3>

<p>If I’d had my critical wits about me at the time, I would have asked questions about where the research for the effectiveness of Brain Gym had come from and discovered that the vast majority of studies in support of the activity were published in Brain Gym International’s own journal…</p>

<h3><strong>2. Will it work in my context? </strong></h3>

<p>Education is a complex business; there are no silver bullets. We can’t assume that a successful innovation in one school will easily translate to our school or our classroom or, indeed, a specific class – there are too many variables. Context is king and therefore we need to use what we know about our own context to assess whether something will likely work for us.</p>

<h3><strong>3. Has it worked? </strong></h3>

<p>Once we’ve implemented something new in the classroom, we need to evaluate whether or not it has worked. Too often we try something without really reflecting on what the impact has been. This leaves us open to ditching effective innovations that we’re a bit bored of and replacing them with something new which might not be as effective.</p>

<h3><strong>4. What next?</strong></h3>

<p>If an innovation has had an impact on students’ learning then not only should we stick with it but we should be asking how generalizable it is. Would it work with other year groups? Teachers? Subjects? If so, share it!</p>

<p>If something you’ve trialled for a period of time has had no impact, or a negative impact, then however much you’ve invested in it and however much you like it you need to have the confidence to ditch it and find something new.</p>

353392,The week my pupils took me to Hades and back,Ancient myth and bleak modern reality collide to teach an old head a valuable lesson about the young,"<p>I should know by now. I’ve been a teacher for 39 years and a head for 27. There I was last month, pondering in my online Tes column how we teachers should try to make sense of an unjust and troubled world for our pupils. What I underestimated was the way in which they often do so quite well without us.</p>

<p>At my school last week, I witnessed a pair of inspiring short plays: a Year 10 GCSE drama set performed two exam pieces, 20-minute works each devised,written and performed by five actors. Both cleverly reinterpreted ancient legends: the Classical setting of Hades brought in Persephone, Orpheus and Eurydice, the river Styx and Cerberus, while George and the Dragon saw a lone warrior seeking his dragon to slay. Both tales were revisited in light of modern Syria, so-called Islamic State, inept international intervention and the refugee crisis. The young casts wove together ancient myth and bleak modern reality with great skill.</p>

<p>Much has been said and written recently about anger among young people; clearly, Jeremy Corbyn’s revived Labour Party has tapped into that. The passion of these young actors was as clear as their interpretations communicated their personal anguish, both at the suffering they see in the Middle East and their inability to do anything about it.</p>

<p>At the end, all of us in the audience felt shaken by the vivid power of what we had witnessed. That’s what the best art should do: move and stir. What was astonishing was the fact that it was 15-year-olds who created that effect, writing and performing work that stemmed from deeply felt feelings.</p>

<p>Recently, I read about a Year 8 Gloucestershire pupil who made his own personal and highly effective contribution to charity WaterAid. Henry Garrard of Wycliffe Preparatory School decided to use just 20 litres of water a day for three days, the quantity most people in Africa get by on. Moreover, he walked 3km to collect it from a spring – the average African distance. The water he was carrying was half his bodyweight, so on the third day he borrowed his dad’s wheelbarrow.</p>

<p>Next he boiled the water on a camping stove, which he also used to cook his food. At the end of each day, only a dribble of water was left for washing. He learnt a lot and raised £540 (you can support him at bit.ly/20Litre).</p>

<p>If such students use original approaches to make sense of the world, others just get on with facing big challenges. I can name one of my students because she is in the public domain.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, Kate Waugh sat an A level English literature exam early (with the exam board’s permission), so that she could dash to the airport and fly to Germany for a competition the same day. She arrived a bit late, but still returned home as European U20 triathlon champion!</p>

<p>There’s a moral here: give young people the skills and techniques to create, and we adults will frequently be amazed by what they produce. They might prove far more imaginative and effective in tackling the world’s ills than my generation has been.</p>

354568,"Attainment gap for 'long-term disadvantaged' pupils is getting worse, study shows",Research finding comes despite focus from the government and Ofsted on pupil-premium children,"<p>The attainment gap between children who are ""long-term disadvantaged"" and their peers has been growing in recent years, new research reveals.</p>

<p>The finding, <a href=""http://educationdatalab.org.uk/2017/07/long-term-disadvantage-part-one-challenges-and-successes/"">published by Education Datalab</a> this afternoon, highlights the challenge facing schools as they are asked to improve the performance of children eligible for the <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/teachers-exceptional-work-praised-pupil-premium-awards"">pupil premium</a>.</p>

<p>The research examines the academic results of children who are eligible for the pupil premium: those who have been entitled to claim free school meals (FSM) at least once in the past six years.</p>

<p>The researchers separated these children into four groups, depending on how long they had been eligible for free school meals, and looked at how their average grade in GCSE subjects compared with the national average in each year since 2008.</p>

<p><img height=""375"" width=""543"" class=""media-element file-default img-responsive"" typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""http://tes.com/sites/default/files/datalab_long_term_disadvantaged_2017-07-26.png"" alt="""" /></p>

<p>They found that all four groups have been below the national average in each year, but only the group of those who had been eligible for FSM the longest – dubbed the ""long-term disadvantaged"" – had seen their attainment gap widen.</p>

<h2>Attainment 'actually falling'</h2>

<p>Education Datalab associate research fellow Mike Treadaway wrote: “Although attainment has been improving for some groups – those FSM-eligible for less than 60 per cent of their time in schools – the improvement has been small for pupils who were FSM-eligible for between 60 per cent and 90 per cent of the time.</p>

<p>“And for pupils who were FSM-eligible on almost every occasion the school census is taken (90 per cent or more of the time), their attainment, relative to the national average, has actually been falling.”</p>

<p>In 2008, attainment of this latter group was similar to children who had been FSM-eligible for 30-60 per cent of the time, and the 60-90 per cent of the time pupils.</p>

<p>However, the disadvantage gap for the 30-60 per cent group started to narrow from 2008, while that for the 60-90 group started to narrow in 2010.</p>

<p>In contrast, the gap between the long-term disadvantaged and the national average started to grow in 2010.</p>

<p>The government gives primary schools an <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pupil-premium-conditions-of-grant-2016-to-2017/pupil-premium-2016-to-2017-conditions-of-grant"">extra £1,320, and secondaries £935</a>, for each pupil who has been eligible for the free schools meals in the past six years, and <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-inspection-handbook-from-september-2015"">Ofsted inspectors are told</a> to “take particular account of the progress made by disadvantaged pupils from their starting points”.</p>

354697,Sats: Will next year bring more tears and turmoil?,Fears that government tinkering won’t be enough to fix primary assessment,"<p>The aftershocks of a major upheaval of primary assessment were still being felt this year – 12 months after the changes had led to widespread anger, an MPs’ inquiry and parents pulling their children out of school.</p>

<p>The past school year began with unions threatening to boycott Sats, and ended with outrage over children losing marks because their semicolons were too big.</p>

<p>The government has made some concessions, such as promising not to brand schools as “failing” based purely on their key stage 2 writing scores – and has consulted on further changes to the system – but will the turmoil continue next year? Here, Tes answers some of the key questions about primary assessment...</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>After so much upheaval in 2016, why did schools want more change for 2017?</strong></p>

<p>Heads had a fraught summer last year. First, they had to explain to pupils and parents why test results had plummeted. Then, the government announced it was keeping a so-called “interim” framework for assessing writing in 2016 in place for another year, while it consulted on changes. Finally, there were wide variations in writing scores across the country, raising questions about the comparability of teachers’ assessments and adding to concerns that schools would be unfairly labelled as failing.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>What changes were made?</strong></p>

<p>In October 2016, education secretary Justine Greening said that no interventions in schools would be made on the basis of 2016 data alone, due to the “pace and scale” of the assessment changes. She also pledged to launch a consultation on the future of primary assessment.</p>

<p>National training and a test were brought in for moderators to help to standardise the way teachers assess pupils’ writing for KS2 Sats.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>How successful were the changes to the writing test?</strong></p>

<p>Two-thirds of moderators incorrectly assessed pupils’ work when tested, Tes revealed (bit.ly/SatsChaos). This raised concerns that the 2017 results would be no more reliable than those in 2016.</p>

<p>Last week, Greening said that the changes to moderators’ training still needed time to bed in, and confirmed that no intervention would be made on the basis of the 2017 writing data. It is also expected that the writing assessments will be changed to a “best-fit” system next year, so pupils do not have to meet all the criteria set out by the government to achieve the expected standard.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>What about the rest of the tests? How was Sats week?</strong></p>

<p>More than 550,000 10-and-11-year-olds took the tests in May. The reading test was generally considered “kinder” than last year but the maths test left some children in tears.</p>

<p>According to Simon Kidwell, head of Hartford Manor primary in Cheshire: “The statutory tests were fairer this year, with the design of the reading test much improved.”</p>

<p>What were the results?</p>

<p>When the results came out in July, they showed that 61 per cent of pupils had achieved the expected standard in reading, writing and maths – up from 53 per cent in 2016.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>The results improved ... surely everyone must be happy?</strong></p>

<p>The results went up, but teachers queried some of the marking. For example, some pupils who had put a semi-colon into a sentence in the correct place were not given a mark; it emerged that there was additional guidance given to markers, specifying the height and shape of the semi-colon (see box, above right).</p>

<p>“Overall, I would say most people’s experience this year was better than last year,” says James Bowen, director of NAHT Edge, an organisation for middle leaders.</p>

<p>“But then 2016 was a particular low. And there were some specific issues with the grammar test [in 2017].”</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Will the system settle down now?</strong></p>

<p>This seems unlikely. Although some tweaks are being made to the current system, there are concerns that they will not go far enough.</p>

<p>Anne Heavey, education policy officer at the ATL teaching union, says: “We still have big concerns about the curriculum that underpins the Sats and how the data from Sats is used. The curriculum demands in English and maths are too high and squeeze out other subjects. The high-stakes nature of the accountability system ramps up the importance of the tested curriculum, rather than the whole curriculum.</p>

<p>“While things have stabilised this year, the actual framework is still problematic.”</p>

<p>The government’s response to its primary assessment consultation is expected in the coming weeks. It is working on a longer-term plan, potentially involving new times-tables tests and the return of a Reception year baseline – both of which are widely opposed.</p>

355327,Teachers fear compulsory extended school days would damage pupils' family life,DfE-commissioned report also shows that pupils worry lengthening school day will reduce the range of activities they take part in,"<p>Teachers fear that any compulsory extension of the school day could increase pressure on pupils and damage their family life, new research published by the DfE has found.</p>

<p>Researchers carried out qualitative research in secondary schools to examine the attitudes of school leaders, teachers, parents, pupils and community groups to extended provision.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/635002/Extended_Activity_Provision_in_Secondary_Schools.pdf"">Their report</a>, published today, says: “Staff and parents could see some potential benefits to a [compulsory] extension, such as more time to engage with life skills and enrichment activities, improved relationships with teaching staff, the school as a safe haven, as well as support for working families.</p>

<p>“However, the perceived negative impact on student pressure, fatigue, impact on family arrangements, student safety, as well as their involvement in activities within the community had much greater weight with parents and staff.”</p>

<p>It says the majority of school leaders “held a predominantly negative view of compulsory extension, both in principle and in practice”.</p>

<h2>'Disruption' to family schedules</h2>

<p>And although some saw the value in the basic concept, they questioned how it would happen in practice. A “small number” were generally positive and supportive.</p>

<p>When the researchers questioned teachers, they found that “concerns focused on the impact on the work-life balance of pupils, the extent to which participation should be intrinsically motivated or imposed, the impact on teachers and practicalities of staffing, and the potential of disruption to family schedules”.</p>

<p>Staff and parents raised concerns that a compulsory extended school day could have “negative effects on family time with children”, as well as compromise their ability to engage in the local community.</p>

<p>And in focus groups, pupils said they believed the range of activities they engaged in would be narrowed, because they would have to give up activities outside of school if the school day was extended.</p>

<p>They were also concerned about their safety and how they would get home. The report adds: “This applied particularly during the winter months, with many pupils expressing discomfort at returning home in the dark.”</p>

355651,Why I love the new English GCSE: a controversial romance,"The new English GCSE might not be perfect, but there are some positives, says this English teacher","<p>For two years we've been discussing the difficulties of the new English GCSE. I agree that there is much to criticise. However, despite the demands of the new course, the difficulties and the uncertainties, the crying to sleep as we contemplate trying to teach <em>that</em> structure question <em>again</em> tomorrow, I love this new <a href=""http://www.tes.com.c.tes.ent.platform.sh/news/school-news/breaking-views/english-morning-history-afternoon-there-a-profound-lack-common-sense"">GCSE</a>. Here are my reasons why:</p>

<h2><strong>1. Teaching modern fiction</strong></h2>

<p>Hurrah, huzzah and hallelujah! We have a fiction paper that allows us to introduce an incredible range of some of the finest 20th and 21st century literature to students.<br />
<br />
Worthy though the canonical texts of the English literature GCSE <a href=""http://www.tes.com.c.tes.ent.platform.sh/news/school-news/breaking-views/three-things-new-gcse-english-literature-course-taught-me-about"">specifications </a>are, some of the writers from the past two centuries are worthy compeers and the language paper enables us to celebrate them. It also means we can introduce students to writing from different cultures, a feature the literature specification is particularly short on.<br />
<br />
The great thing about the extracts you select as part of your planning is that they are frequently engaging snapshots of the books, which have the power to hook in an increasingly literature-resistant audience – one that isn't always interested in much beyond 140 characters accompanied by doggie-face filters. Praise be.</p>

<h2><strong>2. Teaching an entire Shakespeare text</strong></h2>

<p>For some, this may not seem like an advantage. Shakespeare is tough, his language dense and his ideas complex and multi-layered.<br />
<br />
However, beyond those usual challenges, being able to teach an entire Shakespeare play bedded into its context and with elements of modern literary criticism is a joy that previously we have not had at GCSE.<br />
<br />
In the past, many students have left secondary education with no real understanding of why Shakespeare is still relevant. This has frequently been down to the rushed excerpt-based approach that has been prevalent in our classrooms. Now, we finally have the time to truly engage with and enjoy Shakespeare.</p>

<h2><strong>3. I finally feel like I'm really teaching my subject</strong></h2>

<p>Having taught English for 13 years now, I've been through three specification changes.</p>

<p>I will hold my hands up and say that for the first few years, I had little real idea of how the whole course pieced together. What I did know was that, in the past, we spent a <a href=""http://www.tes.com.c.tes.ent.platform.sh/news/school-news/breaking-views/are-you-modelling-good-work-english-or-are-you-just-spoon-feeding"">disproportionate </a>amount of time on 20 per cent of the course (coursework) and then frantically tried to cram in the remaining 80 per cent any which way we could. </p>

Nothing of analysis, nothing of the texts apart from the bits they needed for their essays and no real contextualisation that encouraged students to recognise the importance of literature and the role it plays in reflecting society. The new-not-new drive towards a stronger knowledge-based curriculum means I can <a href=""http://www.tes.com.c.tes.ent.platform.sh/news/school-news/breaking-views/three-tips-teaching-unseen-texts-new-english-language-gcse"">teach </a>a text in its entirety, a privilege usually reserved for A level.</p>

<p>The new <a href=""http://www.tes.com.c.tes.ent.platform.sh/news/school-news/breaking-views/new-gcse-english-exams-are-a-fine-example-going-half-cocked"">English GCSE</a> demands a lot from teachers and students, but I believe it gives back much more. For the students to succeed, the teacher has to teach both content and skills – and they have to teach them well. There is no hiding with these new qualifications. They have to engage. </p>

<p>For too many years it felt as though many students sleepwalked through their English GCSE, got their C grade and left with a soul untouched by the incredible texts they were exposed to. A tragedy.</p>

<p>By closing the loopholes that stripped the subject to its component parts, teaching it has become more challenging than ever, but much more rewarding. Come results day, whatever my students’ outcomes, I stand by my love for the new English GCSE.</p>

<h3>Jefferson Bosela, 20  </h3>

<h3> <img alt=""Results day 2016"" src=""/sites/default/files/jefferson.jpg"" /></h3>

<p>I was extremely naughty when I first started <a href=""http://www.tes.com.c.tes.ent.platform.sh/news/school-news/breaking-views/schools-must-ring-laughter-if-only-antidote-relentless-pursuit"">secondary </a>school. Part of the problem was that I was involved in gang culture. At one point, I was almost permanently excluded from school. The only reason they let me stay was because one teacher put herself on the line for me.</p>

<p>One day, I witnessed a boy being beaten up in the street. I wasn't involved in the attack, but I also didn't step in to help. The next day at school, I saw my teacher crying. She told me that her son had been attacked the night before and had to be taken to hospital. It was the same teacher who had saved me from exclusion. That was the point when I knew things had to change, because there was only so far that the life I was leading could take me.</p>

<p>I was sceptical about A levels at first because people told me how difficult they were. But I pulled up my pants and started to work so hard. I was constantly studying and the teachers were great.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/a-level-results-day-2017-all-you-need-know"">A-level results day</a> was such a relief. I got my grades online first, when I was at home with my mum. She's a really strong woman and she's my motivation. It was a good feeling to be able to give back for all the help she has given me.</p>

<p>At school, my teachers were joking with me and pretending they didn't know my results. But I knew they were proud of me because they asked me to speak to some of the Year 12s, to inspire them and let them know that they could do it too.</p>

<p>I didn't expect to get the <a href=""http://www.tes.com.c.tes.ent.platform.sh/news/school-news/breaking-news/gcses-almost-third-free-schools-below-floor-standard"">grades </a>I did. People who are supposed to be smarter than I am didn't do as well as me. I felt really humbled.</p>

<p>I'm now studying international politics at the University of Surrey. I want to be prime minister. It will be a lot of <a href=""http://www.tes.com.c.tes.ent.platform.sh/news/school-news/breaking-news/gcse-and-a-level-grade-boundaries-publication-delayed-prevent-pupil"">hard work</a>, but I'm used to that now.</p>

<h3>Jefferson's teacher: Izzy Boggild Jones, <a href=""http://www.tes.com.c.tes.ent.platform.sh/news/school-news/breaking-views/new-gcse-english-exams-are-a-fine-example-going-half-cocked"">English </a>and politics teacher, Croydon</h3>

<h3><img alt=""Results day 2016"" src=""/sites/default/files/izzy.jpg"" /></h3>

<p>The environment at the <a href=""http://www.tes.com.c.tes.ent.platform.sh/news/school-news/breaking-news/falls-language-and-science-gcses-five-key-points-todays-exam-entry"">school </a>was definitely challenging. There were quite a few behavioural issues, many of the kids needed a lot of support and there was high teacher turnover.</p>

<p>Many of the students I taught were the first in their families to go to university, which can be really daunting. Of the five boys who I taught in A2 politics, there was one who had sky-high aspirations. Jefferson was a really popular pupil and loved being the centre of attention. Not all his friends were as focused on studying as he was, so I imagine it was very difficult for him not to get distracted.</p>

<p>But Jefferson didn't lose sight of his goal: to get to university and have a great career. He was always asking about the jobs of people I knew, what those jobs were like and how much they paid.</p>

<p>Jefferson didn't need any encouragement to write extra practice essays. He would bring them to me in the office, standing by as I marked them. If he had missed a mark, he'd want to know why, or he'd try to demonstrate that his work deserved a higher grade.</p>

<p>I knew that he could do the work, but I had doubts that my lessons had prepared him well enough. After each exam I waited nervously to ask the boys: ""How did it go? What questions came up? What did you argue?""</p>

<p>The morning of results day was really busy. Jefferson was delighted with his grades and was grateful for all the work his teachers had put in. Even in the chaos of results day, he made sure that he took the time to thank us.</p>

<p>I was thrilled when Jefferson achieved the A <a href=""http://www.tes.com.c.tes.ent.platform.sh/news/school-news/breaking-views/gcse-exams-i-have-a-bad-feeling-about"">grade </a>he had worked so hard for. I felt like a proud parent.</p>

<h3>Anya Eastman, 19</h3>

<h3><img alt=""Results day 2016"" src=""/sites/default/files/anya.jpg"" /></h3>

<p>My memories of results day are awful. When you haven't been accepted on to the course you want because you missed a grade, nothing else seems good enough. All my friends had been accepted to their first choices and my boyfriend was going to read medicine at Oxford. I didn't want to be the only one who compromised.</p>

<p>I had an alternative offer from my first-choice university, Royal Holloway, to study a different course. But I spent results day calling around <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/clearing-2016-your-frequently-asked-questions"">clearing </a>and didn't make up my mind to accept the alternative offer until the next day. Then, as I clicked the button to accept my offer online, an email came through telling me that the course was now full.</p>

<p>Luckily, I was on the phone to Mrs Ludlam at the time. She calmed me down and told me to call the university. The woman I spoke to said that if I had clicked that button five seconds later, the place would have gone to somebody in <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/clearing-2016-your-frequently-asked-questions"">clearing</a>. As it was, I had accepted just in time.</p>

<p>If I hadn't had such encouragement from teachers I really trusted, things could have worked out very differently.</p>

<h3>Anya's teacher: Belinda Ludlam, director of sixth-form learning, Hampshire</h3>

<h3><img alt=""Results day 2016"" src=""/sites/default/files/belinda.jpg"" /></h3>

<p><a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/alevels2016"">A-level results day</a> is much easier for heads of sixth-form than it used to be. In previous decades, the day passed in a series of tense negotiations on the phone with admissions tutors. We were the first to know whether a student had significantly overachieved or underachieved, and we were ready to fight their corner.</p>

<p>These days, students arrive at school with a grin to pick up their results, already knowing that they have a place at their chosen university (whereas we have fretted for 18 hours over the fact that they have missed a grade). Last year was no different, until Anya arrived.</p>

<p>She had been ambitious throughout sixth-form. Her attendance was excellent and her work ethic was strong. We knew she had missed the top grade she needed for her first-choice offer to read English literature at Royal Holloway, but that she was likely to be offered a place at her insurance university to read the same subject.</p>

<p>But when we spoke to her, we found out that Royal Holloway had made Anya an alternative offer for a related literature course. She was paralysed with indecision.</p>

<p>It seemed an easy choice to us, but Anya turned things over and over and did not see the urgency of her situation. She talked about gaining a degree in a subject she did not really value and the fees she would owe for the privilege.</p>

<p>Having seen how rapidly things can change on results day in terms of places being filled, we knew the decision might be taken from her if she didn't act fast. We urged her to take the place at Royal Holloway and try to switch courses once she was there.</p>

<p>After lengthy persuasion, Anya accepted the new offer in the nick of time. Within a month she had been offered a place on the course she originally wanted as someone had dropped out. She was overjoyed, but her hesitation almost made her miss out completely.</p>

<h3>Beth Hall, 20</h3>

<h3><img alt=""Results day 2016"" src=""/sites/default/files/beth.jpg"" /></h3>

<p>Results day was overwhelming for me. I had been expecting a C to be my highest grade, so I was chuffed when I found out I had achieved ABC. I was just a few marks off another B, so I almost did even better.</p>

<p>My grades exceeded the offer of BCC that I had from the University of Preston, but I wanted to go there anyway so that I could live at home and commute.</p>

<p>I tend to do better in smaller places. When I started my A levels, I went to a college in Blackburn for two months. It was too big and I wasn't used to being in large classes after always being in smaller, bottom-set groups. Luckily, I was able to transfer back to my old school and my grades began to improve significantly.</p>

<p>My degree is the most challenging thing I've ever done, but I'm loving it and am on track for a first. It's my ambition to become an art therapist.</p>

<p>My advice to those receiving their results this year is to remember that it's not the end of the road, no matter what you get.</p>

<h3>Beth's teacher: Lauren Davey, second in RE and assistant head of year 11, Lancashire</h3>

<h3><img alt=""Results day 2016"" src=""/sites/default/files/lauren.jpg"" /></h3>

<p>On paper, Beth was not the kind of pupil who would have been able to access A levels at all – she was predicted to get D and E grades. But she had things that many students do not: a positive attitude and a strong work ethic.</p>

<p>I first taught her when she was in Year 11. The class was a bottom set and there were a number of behaviour problems, but Beth was a calming influence on the group. She would work with anyone and offer help wherever it was needed.</p>

<p>That year, we were raising money for a school trip to India to visit an orphanage supported by the charity Shining Faces. Although Beth had exams to think about, she became involved in fundraising by helping to run church quizzes and a band night.</p>

<p>On the trip, Beth's giving nature shone through in the way she interacted with the orphans. Being able to handle your emotions and still be able to help others is a rare skill.</p>

<p>I was already proud of Beth, but her final grades were a surprise to us all. On results day, the girl who had been predicted Ds and Es received grades of ABC. What's more, she earned herself a place to study mental health nursing at the University of Preston. I was so pleased for her, because she really got what she deserved for all the hard work she had put in.</p>

<h3>Christian Riley, 20</h3>

<h3><img alt=""Results day 2016"" src=""/sites/default/files/christian.jpg"" /></h3>

<p>I was frustrated and angry when I opened my results and saw that I had a B in geography – I felt I had worked hard enough to get at least an A. But then I realised that <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/ofqual-begin-major-new-research-exam-marking-errors"">something had to be wrong</a>, because I had zero marks for one of the papers.</p>

<p>My plan was to go to King's College London to read human geography. The grade requirements were AAB, but I only had ABB and an A* in general studies, which was excluded from my offer.</p>

<p>The school was excellent. Before I had even arrived it had sent my paper off for a <a href=""http://www.tes.com.c.tes.ent.platform.sh/news/school-news/breaking-views/how-navigate-new-exam-appeals-system"">re-mark</a>. Mr Parker assured me that the mark would change and told me it was the strangest result he had ever seen.</p>

<p>Things turned out fine in the end: the university accepted me regardless and I found out a week later that my grade had changed to an A. But at the time, it really made me doubt my abilities in terms of geography. I may have been tempted to change course to history, had the mark not been corrected so quickly and had Mr Parker not been so reassuring and supportive on results day.</p>

<h3>Christian's teacher: Tim Parker, geography and boys' games teacher, Stockton-on-Tees</h3>

<h3><img alt=""Results day 2016"" src=""/sites/default/files/tim.jpg"" /></h3>

<p>It was a shock when we realised that one of our most promising geographers had scored zero out of a possible 80 marks on a paper. I mean, as long as you write something down you will probably score more than zero, and this was a hard-working student who had a real interest in geography and planned to study the subject at university. What's more, he had come out of his exams feeling positive and confident that he had gained the grades he wanted. The result did not make sense.</p>

<p>In the initial hours after we received Chris' results, we contacted the exam board and it agreed to re-mark the paper. I was 99 per cent sure that the mark was a mistake, but there was nothing more I could do.</p>

<p>When Chris arrived at school, he was scared that the mark would affect his chances to study the subject he loved and was confused about what had gone wrong. He was losing confidence, and our job was to reassure and support him.</p>

<p>After the re-mark, Chris' paper was returned with a score of 64, taking his final grade to a high A and allowing him to meet the requirements of his initial offer. It's heartwrenching when a student doesn't get the grades they want, especially when they have put in the effort. Thankfully, Chris was accepted to university with the grade he received on results day, but it could so easily have turned out another way.</p>

356248,"Opportunity areas could face 'unrealistic expectations', warns DfE research","The ambitions of a government scheme to help pupils in disadvantaged areas may be set too high, according to a Department for Education study","<p>The risk that a flagship government scheme to increase social mobility could face ""unrealistic expectations"" has been raised in research carried out for the Department for Education.</p>

<p>The research looked at early plans to create 12 <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/government-unveils-six-new-opportunity-areas-target-schools-social"">""opportunity areas"",</a> which are aimed at improving schools and supporting teachers in disadvantaged parts of the country.</p>

<p>The £72 million scheme was <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/justine-greening-announces-ps60-million-target-schools-social"">announced</a> with fanfare by education secretary Justine Greening last year as a way of boosting ""social mobility cold spots"".</p>

<p>According to a summary of a research paper, published today, a key risk attached to the programme is ""unrealistic expectations"".</p>

<h2>'Expectations may be too high'</h2>

<p>The research involved an analysis of the early implementation plans produced by each opportunity area, as well as consultations with DfE analysts and policymakers, and a literature review.</p>

<p>The summary states: ""There is a danger that expectations of programme impact may be set too high.""</p>

<p>It adds: ""Given the diverse and overlapping nature of the interventions, it is unlikely that any impact against the headline indicators at local area level will be detected by 2020.""</p>

<p>Therefore, it says: ""It might be necessary to set a longer time horizon to allow sufficient headline outcomes to materialise.""</p>

<p>The research also finds that clarity will be needed on the most consistent measures for judging the project's success in individual areas.</p>

<p>The document says: ""Within the opportunity area programme there is a danger of introducing a disconnect between what local programmes are seeking to achieve and how they will ultimately be assessed by the end of the evaluation.""</p>

<p>The findings will feed into the way the programme is evaluated, the paper states.</p>

357181,Let’s all shout our good news from the rooftops,Too often teaching is portrayed in a negative light in the media these days – but maybe we can change perceptions of the profession by using different language,"<p>When I was at university, I met a student who remains a good friend today. She is an American with a wicked sense of humour. When learning German, she was taught the phrase, “Germany is the size of California.” Analiese, being Analiese, changed this to say, “Germany is ONLY the size of California.” With the addition of that one word, she changed it from a fact to a boast. She was just playing with words and never used this phrase to upset any German friends (to the best of my knowledge!). But she showed that one word has the power to change the entire tone of a sentence.</p>

<p>Perhaps the same is true in education, and we can dramatically change what we say by adding or removing a few words. Indeed, devilment aside, we can add words to give a positive spin on events and learning.</p>

<h2>A positive mindset</h2>

<p>As a maths teacher, I am most familiar with the power of positivity that growth mindset can bring. Pupils who have been exposed to this philosophy enjoy adding the word “yet” to just about any phrase. No longer do they say, “I haven’t done my homework.” Now they tell us, “I haven’t done my homework – yet!” (Obviously, I will reply along the lines of, “I haven’t called your mum about this – yet.”)</p>

<p>Growth mindset provides good examples of how schools’ engagement with the media can be approached in a different way. On a national level, we read really positive stories, such as, in Aberdeen, three entire subject areas have been fully booked in initial teacher training. Or should we read that as only three subject areas have been filled? It depends on your mindset. Maybe we will, one day, talk about our pay rise being “<em>only</em> (actually, any number greater than zero here would be nice) per cent”. The optimists among us may say, before there is even any inkling of an announcement on salaries, “We haven’t had a pay rise this year – yet!”</p>

<p>A school community really is a wonderful thing. It isn’t just the teachers and pupils – you also have the non-teaching staff. Add in the parents, the local police, the local politicians, shopkeepers, business owners and volunteers in the community, and the school community grows vastly. Every single one of these people wants a school to do well. The local paper is, then, a vital outlet for shouting good news from the rooftops. In return, local papers need schools to share their news – I only ever buy a copy if there is likely to be school news involving my own children. We do sometimes hit a national paper with good news, and I was recently involved in one such article: world champion curler Eve Muirhead talked with our science pupils about friction and technological advances in her sport (a curling brush doesn’t even look like a brush now, it seems). It was great to see that reflected in positive news in a national paper, which showed how pupils seeing science’s impact beyond the classroom can be potentially life-changing.</p>

<p>Politicians do seek headlines in national papers, obviously, and there is sometimes friction between unions, acting on our behalf, and politicians which results in negative news. There has been talk lately of negative media reports putting people off becoming a teacher and driving away some who were already working in classrooms; to be honest, a lack of meaningful pay rises is more likely to be a factor than negative headlines.</p>

<p>It is true, though, that teachers don’t always get portrayed positively in the media. Parents read “strike” and think “childcare disaster”, so when a work-to-rule on workload was announced, headlines like “Teachers to strike” seemed to paint the profession in a bad light.</p>

<h2>Share your success</h2>

<p>Maybe, as a profession, we need to get more proficient at sharing our positive news more widely than just with the local papers. Maybe national papers would benefit from listening to our positive news, too. So many people will only buy a paper if there is something covered that they are particularly interested in. If teaching and learning was of higher media value, not merely filling the gaps just before the classifieds, there could be a critical mass gained of enthusiasm for reading about school successes. This could lead to more schools sharing positive news. More papers would be sold as well. Wouldn’t that feel great?</p>

<p>For now, most of us probably have a few social media outlets. It won’t take long to add in one word here or there to make our news about school even more positive, or take out that word which makes it too negative. All you and I, the people at the chalk (or pixel) face, can do just now is keep fighting the good fight and showing that the job is great (and perhaps even worthy of a modest pay rise before I retire in 25 years’ time). Let’s share all the great news – in as many ways as we can.</p>

357295,GCSE results 2017: Schools with 'good' English departments query unexpected grades,Headteachers' union predicts an increase in requests for re-marks after reports of 'unpredictable' English results,"<p>Schools with ""good"" English departments have seen a drop in their <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/gcse""><u><font color=""#0066cc"">GCSE</font></u></a> results in the subject this year, according to a headteachers' union. </p>

<p>This summer, reformed GCSEs in English language, English literature and maths were sat by thousands of pupils. </p>

<p>The new GCSEs have been awarded under a new numerical grading system – from 9 to 1 instead of A* to C. </p>

<p>The Association of School and College Leaders has been contacted about ""unpredictable"" English results at some secondary schools. </p>

<p>Geoff Barton, general secretary of the ASCL, said: ""We are picking up stories of schools with good, well-established English departments that get good results every year [that have] seen a drop in their results.</p>

<p>“You have got schools reporting very unpredictable results, with some students getting a grade 3 in English whereas their other grades are much higher.""</p>

<h2>'Don't jump to any conclusions'</h2>

<p>Mr Barton added: “It was always predicted that national standards would remain the same but individual standards would drop in some schools.</p>

<p>“But, of course, if that happens on your watch it is very hard not to take it personally. We just want to keep reassuring those school leaders and governors not to jump to any conclusions.</p>

<p>“We spoke to Ofsted yesterday about the importance of their inspectors not jumping to conclusions if they are coming into a school after potentially a year where there has been a dip in results.""</p>

<p>Suzanne O’Farrell, a curriculum and assessment specialist at the ASCL, said they have seen some schools reporting ""swings in results"". </p>

357688,Commissioner’s new guiding role: hatchet man or helping hand?,Expert advice to become available as part of an expanded ‘self-improving system’,"<p>If the FE commissioner turns up at your college’s reception, the situation is already grave. At present, Richard Atkins and his team of deputies are drafted in to intervene in cases when a college fails an Ofsted inspection, or is found to be financially inadequate.</p>

<p>But a radical expansion of the commissioner’s role is on the way. Rather than simply being summoned to deal with failing colleges, changes are being drawn up that would also make the FE commissioner the first port of call for institutions in need of advice and support.</p>

<p>In July, education secretary Justine Greening announced plans for a £15 million college improvement fund – and that the commissioner’s role was to be extended to take in sixth-form colleges. It has emerged that this is part of a more substantial expansion of the commissioner’s remit.</p>

<p>While the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) will continue be responsible for intervening when colleges are in serious financial difficulty, the FE commissioner is expected to be asked take the lead on interventions around the quality of provision.</p>

<p>There will also be a second level of involvement, which will include offering additional assistance to colleges at deemed to be risk of seeing their performance deteriorate, with a view to address problems before they become entrenched. All colleges rated as “requires improvement” by Ofsted are expected to come within the scope of the programme.</p>

<h2>Spreading knowledge</h2>

<p>Under the scheme, expert guidance will be made available from a cadre of “National Leaders of Further Education”. Between 30 and 40 principals and chief executives of successful colleges are expected to be recruited, Tes understands. In her speech to the British Chambers of Commerce during the summer, Greening outlined that these leaders will be “empowered to spread their expert knowledge, as well as mentor and support weaker parts of the system”.</p>

<p>College leaders were due to meet Department for Education officials this week to discuss how the new system of support and intervention might operate, and how to make best use of the allocated £15 million budget over two years.</p>

<p>David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, says: “This is an important move and I think we should all try to make it work. It’s about helping people who need help in difficult times.</p>

<p>“A key element is that it would be voluntary for colleges to come and ask for help. It’s a positive move, but I think it’s going to be difficult to make happen.”</p>

<p>Expert advice should be made available from leaders with experience of running both sixth-form and FE colleges, according to Bill Watkin, chief executive of the Sixth Form Colleges’ Association.</p>

<p>Any move to develop cooperation across institutions could help the approach of a “self-improving system”, widely accepted across the schools sector, transfer over to FE.</p>

<p>To date, the FE commissioner has published 10 college intervention reports in 2017. In the same period, four institutions have formally moved out of intervention after making substantial improvements.</p>

<h2>‘Robust and meaningful’</h2>

<p>According to the most recent ESFA data, colleges are currently subject to 63 notices of concern. Two-thirds of these (40) are for financial health, with the rest being issued over financial control (four), inspection (nine), apprenticeship standards (eight) or the standards of overall education and training (two).</p>

<p>Ealing, Hammersmith and West London College was subject to notices of concern over its financial health and inspection performance, dating back to 2014 and 2015 respectively, as well as being subject to FE commissioner intervention. However, in May its overall Ofsted grade rose from “inadequate” to “good”. The interventions are expected to end shortly.</p>

<p>Garry Phillips, the chief executive of the college, who was appointed in 2014, says he treated FE commissioner intervention as “free consultancy”. “We found it to be a very supportive, challenging, robust and meaningful dialogue around what needed to be improved, and how we needed to improve it,” he says.</p>

<p>“One of the challenges for the commissioner and his team is to get the indicators in place, to say to colleges that are about to fall over, ‘Let’s have a conversation’ before they do – that’s time well invested and money well spent. It’s always better to go to the GP to get the medicine and treat the symptoms early on, rather than to wait until you need remedial surgery.”</p>

<p>The DfE declined to comment.</p>

357721,Do car mechanics really need to study Brontë?,"GCSE resits put brick walls in front of our vocational students. Instead, let’s offer literacy and numeracy pathways relevant to their careers, says Alison Birkinshaw","<p>Most of us start a journey by thinking about where we want to end up. We know that we want our young people to be numerate and literate; able to think, analyse, interpret, make decisions and come to opinions based upon a solid grasp of the information available. The question is, how do we get there?</p>

<p>I think we would all agree that every individual without confidence in literacy and numeracy should be given the opportunity to develop those skills in a supportive and effective environment. But I think many of us would also agree that the current funding condition, through which young people without a C or a grade 4 at GCSE in English and maths are effectively forced to continue to study towards that GCSE, is a flawed policy.</p>

<p>We want our young people to be confident in their use of language and numbers, so we set them on that journey.</p>

<p>We put a brick wall in front of them and ask them to get over it. If they don’t manage it the first time, we take them back to square one and ask them to run up against that brick wall time and time again.</p>

<p>While a small number manage to scale the obstacle at a second and third attempt, many sit at the bottom with their confidence dented, remaining thoroughly demoralised. Surely we should be finding these students a different route to the same destination?</p>

<h2>Stranger than fiction</h2>

<p>I recently observed an all-male class of motor vehicle students preparing to sit their GCSE in English. They were studying 19th-century non-fiction and comparing a letter written by Charlotte Brontë, describing her time as a governess, with a modern broadsheet newspaper article on roughly the same topic.</p>

<p>They were desperate to pass the GCSE, and working very hard to meet the exam requirements. I love the writings of all the Brontë sisters and would endorse any opportunity to introduce young men and women to these great works. But do motor vehicle students really need to develop skills in interpreting a non-fiction language and the style of long-gone writing? Wouldn’t it be better for them to learn how to understand and interpret today’s language, to understand how to handle the complex technical instructions needed in their line of work? It would appear not: this June’s AQA GCSE paper required candidates to interpret and analyse a Victorian newspaper article describing how the writer felt now that her son had grown up. I have a feeling that the brick wall we are expecting our young people to climb is now placed on completely the wrong path and is not taking us where we want to go at all.</p>

<p>So what is the alternative? Pragmatically speaking, there are probably two routes that could take our young people in the right direction. Some students will need to achieve a grade 4 or higher at GCSE because they need this qualification for their future career. But I would suggest that the majority of students on a range of vocational qualifications would benefit from other approaches.</p>

<h2>A vocational approach</h2>

<p>Firstly, the vocational qualifications themselves (whether T levels, apprenticeships or other qualifications) should embed the type of literacy and numeracy skills required in the specification design and the assessment requirements, in a stepped way. This would allow students to explicitly learn these skills through their main qualification, and employers could have the confidence that the young person is competent in their grasp of the language and numbers that are required for the job in hand.</p>

<p>If we designed these qualifications well then that could be enough to take us to where we want to be. However, sometimes it is helpful to “belt and braces it”, as we say at my college. So, with some thought and creativity, it should be possible to design separate but aligned English and maths qualifications, which test the skills we want to develop in all individuals, whether young or old, and which allow us to place the student not only on the right path, but also on the right point on that path without the pressure of institutional “progress measures” or brick walls.</p>

<p>If we want our young people to make this journey successfully, we shouldn’t expect them all to travel at the same pace. We should offer appropriate support and markers along the way, and we should make sure that the view at the end is going to be worth the effort. In other words, the pursuit of English and maths should be part of a broader education that will provide the foundations for life rather than just the skills required to pass the exam at the required grade.</p>

<p>Otherwise, in the words of Charlotte Brontë herself, “prejudices, it is well known, are most difficult to eradicate from the heart whose soil has never been loosened or fertilised by education: they grow there, firm as weeds among stones.”</p>

357805,Teach First ‘would be a historic shift’,"Most think scheme won’t launch in Scotland, poll shows","<p>The decision on whether to allow Teach First into Scotland will be a seminal moment akin to Emmanuel Macron’s rise to power in France, according to an expert on the history of Scottish education.</p>

<p>But the education sector is split on whether the move will actually happen. While some predict that the introduction of a modified version of the fast-track teacher-training scheme is now almost certain, many others remain sceptical that Teach First will appear north of the border at all.</p>

<p>Professor Lindsay Paterson, of the University of Edinburgh’s School of Social and Political Science, told <em>Tes Scotland</em> that “one thing is fairly certain: the publicity [around Teach First] is making this into a test case of how determined the Scottish government is to reform the institutional structures of education, and to reform how policy is made”.</p>

<p>He added: “It is, in a sense, Swinney’s ‘Macron moment’: to get anything done, it is necessary to overcome institutions and organisations that have resisted change. So, whether Teach First does come to Scotland or not, the outcome will tell us a great deal about the balance of power between the Scottish government and civic institutions.”</p>

<p>President Macron swept to power in May with a political party formed only a year previously, in what was seen as a rejection of establishment institutions. Another expert on Scottish education institutions, Tom Bryce, emeritus professor at the University of Strathclyde, also believes that bringing Teach First to Scotland would represent a historic shift.</p>

<p><img height=""454"" width=""1000"" class=""media-element file-default img-responsive"" typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""http://tes.com/sites/default/files/tess010917_08_stats.png"" alt="""" /></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Professor Bryce, who co-edits the reference book <em>Scottish Education</em>, explained that a teacher-education model that “sidestepped” or “bypassed” universities for independent or commercial training bodies would result in “every safeguard” around teacher education being “emasculated” and leave central government with excessive power.</p>

<p>Teach First has hit the headlines frequently since <em>Tes Scotland</em> revealed in June that it could be coming to Scotland, including reports that the Prince of Wales lobbied the Scottish government on behalf of Teach First in 2012 and that, in 2011, officials from the charity indicated to Education Scotland that they would like to see the General Teaching for Council for Scotland (GTCS) disbanded.</p>

<p>However, a Twitter poll (see right) suggested that many believe Teach First will not come to Scotland, although some senior figures in higher education privately told <em>Tes Scotland</em> that there seemed a high chance of a modified form appearing, perhaps with a remit to address science, technology and engineering (Stem) teacher shortages.</p>

<p>Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the EIS teaching union, said: “Teach First seems to be desperately seeking publicity, which perhaps suggests it doesn’t have a Scottish university partner, without which it cannot proceed.”</p>

<p>However, Seamus Searson, general secretary of the Scottish Secondary Teachers’ Association, said: “I fear with the pressure to find a quick solution, and pressure from HRH Prince Charles, [the Scottish government] may bend.”</p>

<h2>Primary objectives</h2>

<p>A number of the recent media stories about Teach First came through freedom of information requests submitted by further education lecturer and writer James McEnaney, who told <em>Tes Scotland</em>: “There’s no doubt that Teach First are absolutely determined to get into Scotland and the signs are that the Scottish government is keen for this to happen, even if they won’t say so publicly.”</p>

<p>Teach First executive director James Westhead said the charity’s “primary objective” was to tackle the attainment gap and improve the education of children from the most deprived communities – “a goal we share with the Scottish government and the many other people we have spoken with already in Scotland”. He added: “We are confident that the available evidence demonstrates that our model works elsewhere around the world, and believe a bespoke programme could complement, not compete with, existing pathways in Scotland.</p>

<p>“We have not yet seen the specification for the Scottish government’s proposals for a new route into teaching, but we will examine it carefully once it is published to assess our suitability as a potential bidder.”</p>

<p>A spokeswoman for the GTCS said that it had had discussions with Teach First “on a few occasions over the years” but that “the principle of meeting the GTCS Standards for Registration before becoming a teacher will continue in Scotland”.</p>

<p>She added that “we are also working with universities to offer a range of more flexible-entry options to teaching and this work will continue” and that meeting full GTCS standards “will remain the benchmark for aspiring teachers.”</p>

<p>A Scottish government spokesman said it was finalising the tender specification for a new route into teaching and anticipated that “a number of parties will be interested in bringing forward proposals”.</p>

<p>He added: “We are clear that this new route into teaching will require both the involvement of a university to maintain academic rigour and GTCS accreditation.</p>

<p>“The primary aim of this programme is to broaden the range of people entering the teaching profession while giving them the skills and knowledge they need to excel at teaching. This is not about fast-tracking the qualification of new teachers.”</p>

357880,'The funding disparities between county schools and urban schools is vast – we need urgent action',"Significant progress has been made on school funding, but the proposed reforms don’t go far enough – it’s time for a radical overhaul, writes one council leader ","<p>A parent who has recently moved 25 minutes from Mile End in London to Brentwood in Essex might be concerned to find out that their child’s new school, on average, will receive £2,619 less per pupil in government funding compared to their old school in the capital.<br />
<br />
Does this sound odd? There are <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/funding"">countless numbers of discrepancies and quirks like this within the way schools are currently funded</a>.</p>

<p>Even the funding differences inside the capital are hard to fathom. Schools in Hackney, an inner London borough, receive £6,847 per pupil on average. Schools in Waltham Forest, an outer London borough, which borders Hackney, receive £5,271 per pupil.</p>

<p>How much funding your local school gets is a postcode lottery, even within London.<br />
<br />
However, it is county schools that suffer the most adverse impacts from this funding methodology that is now 12 years old. Analysis from the County Councils Network (CCN) shows that last year, counties received 43 per cent less funding on average per student compared to councils in inner London. This is inexplicable.<br />
<br />
Rural schools, largely located in county areas, are the ones that are teetering more closely to the precipice; facing acute funding pressures due to location, smaller pupil numbers, and retention of teachers.</p>

<p>Funding inequalities between schools is an issue that is becoming more mainstream – in July, 4,000 headteachers from 17 different counties wrote to their local MPs to outline the impact this was having on their schools.<br />
<br />
Despite this, 89 per cent of schools overseen by county authorities are rated ""good"" or above by Ofsted; not an insignificant achievement considering funding discrepancies. Clearly, our headteachers and teachers are doing an excellent job at the coalface.</p>

<h2>Cuts beginning to bite</h2>

<p>However, as teachers on the frontline are well aware, budgetary cuts and an unfair method of funding county schools are beginning to bite in the classroom. Last year, the National Audit Office estimated schools will have to generate £3 billion worth of savings by 2020, due to rising pupil numbers and real-terms cuts in funding.</p>

<p>That’s why CCN’s recent post-election manifesto, <a href=""http://www.countycouncilsnetwork.org.uk/download/965/""><strong><em><u>A New Deal for Counties</u></em></strong></a>, put schools funding and reform at the heart of our offer to work with the government to deliver a fairer deal for our areas.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the government agrees, calling current methodology ""outdated and opaque"", promising to rebalance funding. Perhaps due to the political landscape of the time, details on a final funding formula were postponed until September.</p>

<p>The initial formula – while on the right track – did have some issues that need ironing out. Indeed, a CCN survey of county cabinet members for education showed that 79 per cent of them felt the initial formula’s impact would be negative.<br />
<br />
Concerns were raised that over 1,000 rural schools would actually lose funding under the new methodology. Considering their aforementioned pressures, this could threaten their existence in some places. Many county leaders felt that was unacceptable.<br />
<br />
To that end, we want ministers to set out a core baseline of funding that cannot be dropped under; a baseline of money that will allow each school to maintain acceptable teacher-pupil ratios, and, by extension, ensure their future sustainability.<br />
<br />
Before the summer recess, the government announced £1.3 billion in schools funding, taken from elsewhere in the education budget, and starting in 2018-19. Justine Greening said this would provide at least £4,800 per pupil on average.</p>

<p>Clearly this is a step in the right direction, but does it go far enough?<br />
<br />
If all county schools were brought up to that average, they would still receive over £1,400 less per pupil than in those in the best-funded settings. For some big secondary schools, this figure will run into millions. Therein lies the answer to the question above.<br />
<br />
When the government outlines its final national funding formula, it must go further than this. It must set out a clear timetable for delivering a ""fair"" formula that reflects the true cost of providing a high-quality education, regardless of location, and that makes some real inroads in bridging the gap.</p>

<h2>Creating a fair formula</h2>

<p>At the same time, a basic uplift in per pupil funding will not deliver a truly ""fair"" formula and certainly would not wipe out historical inequities. It is vital that the additional needs funding weightings are adjusted and targeted to address attainment gaps between county pupils and urban ones, such as those that exist for children in need and in receipt of free school meals. Figures from 2016-17 show that 30 per cent of pupils receiving free school meals in counties achieved 5 GCSE A* to Cs, while half of those pupils in London obtained those grades.<br />
<br />
Just 15 per cent of those in counties receiving free school meals go into further education, according to latest figures. The number in London is 40 per cent.</p>

<p>More must be done to bridge these clear gaps. If these inconsistencies are allowed to continue moving forwards then there could be long-lasting effects for children in county areas and the economy as a whole. CCN is working with Localis to propose reforms to further education; the report will be published soon.</p>

<p>Other issues persist in counties. County leaders are becoming increasingly concerned about funding for school transport, whether that be coaches or more specialist vehicles for disabled students. Rural areas are more sparsely populated, so therefore the financial burden is bigger.<br />
<br />
And finally, the rise of academies poses challenges. Less than one in 10 county schools were academies in 2011. This year, it is 38 per cent. Councils do not have powers to force academies to expand where there is a population increase. With counties’ population predicted to swell over the next decade, particularly in the Home Counties, councils must have powers to implore academies to expand where there is clear extra demand.<br />
<br />
In rebalancing funding, there are always going to be winners and losers. In an ideal world, no-one would lose out.</p>

<p>But there is a clear imperative for change; we cannot continue with a system whereby a county school 20 miles down the road from an urban one is receiving millions less in funding.</p>

<p>The government recognise this, and county leaders want to work collaboratively with ministers to deliver a new methodology rooted in fairness. We await this month’s announcement and implore the government to be bold.</p>

<p>Fairly-funded schools will go a long way to ensuring the government fulfils its promise of an ""economy that works for everyone"".</p>

","<p>A parent who has recently moved 25 minutes from Mile End in London to Brentwood in Essex might be concerned to find out that their child’s new school, on average, will receive £2,619 less per pupil in government funding compared to their old school in the capital.<br /><br />
Does this sound odd? There are <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/funding"">countless numbers of discrepancies and quirks like this within the way schools are currently funded</a>.</p>

358183,"'Pay squeeze leaves teachers £5,000 worse off'",Labour say pay rises lagging behind inflation has contributed to crisis in recruitment and retention,"<p>Teachers are more than £5,000 a year worse off in real terms compared with 2010 as a result of the public sector <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/pay-and-conditions"">pay squeeze</a>, according to analysis by Labour.</p>

<p>Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said the failure of average wages to keep up with inflation had <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/teachers-pay-review-body-flags-real-risk-schools-not-being-able"">contributed to a crisis in teacher recruitment and retention</a>.</p>

<p>According to Labour's analysis, if wages had risen in line with CPI inflation, the mean salary paid to teachers in England would have risen from £34,800 in 2010 to almost £40,500 in 2016 instead of the actual figure of £35,100.</p>

<p>Ms Rayner said: ""It is no surprise that schools are facing a crisis in teacher recruitment and retention when the government has handed teachers a real-terms pay cut year after year.</p>

<p>""These stark figures show that the average teacher is now thousands of pounds worse off than they were in 2010, and the government's plans to continue with the public sector pay cap will only make matters worse.""</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/dfe-confirms-overall-1-cent-pay-rise-teachers"">The 1 per cent cap on pay increases</a> is set to take the mean average salary for 2017 to £35,451 whereas inflation-linked rises would mean a £41,470 wage.</p>

<p>Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT union, told the Observer that teachers were struggling to make ends meet.</p>

<p>""The latest statistics indicate that more than a quarter are having to rely on credit cards, overdrafts and payday loans to make ends meet every month, and many new and recently qualified teachers are unable to afford to rent or buy a home,"" she said.</p>

<p>""To continue to provide high-quality public education for every child, we need a teacher workforce which is competitively remunerated and to restore teaching as the profession of choice for UK graduates.""</p>

<p>A Department for Education spokesman said: ""There are now more teachers in our schools than ever before - 15,500 more since 2010.</p>

<p>""Overall the number of new teachers entering our classrooms outnumbers those who retire or leave.</p>

<p>""We take teacher recruitment very seriously which is why we are investing £1.3 billion up to 2020 to continue to attract the best and brightest into teaching and have given headteachers freedom over teacher pay, including the ability to pay good teachers more.""</p>

<p>Officials pointed out that teachers had benefited from the repeated increases in the personal allowance, handing an income tax cut of more than £1,000 to a basic-rate taxpayer.</p>

359092,"Government 'cannot show' it is doing enough to keep teachers in the classroom, warns watchdog",The National Audit Office finds vast majority of secondary school headteachers feel the government is failing to help them with high-quality teacher recruitment,"<p>The Department for Education cannot show that its attempts to keep teachers in the classroom are having a positive impact on recruitment or are good value for money, according to the government's spending watchdog.</p>

<p>Today's report also warns that secondary schools are facing significant challenges in recruiting enough teachers to keep pace with rising pupil numbers.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of teachers left England's schools before reaching retirement age last year and headteachers are finding it difficult to fill jobs with good-quality candidates, the report states.</p>

<p>It says that almost 35,000 qualified teachers (34,910) left the profession for reasons other than retirement last year.</p>

<h2>Recruitment reduction</h2>

<p>Overall, the number of full-time equivalent teachers in state-funded schools increased by 15,500 (3.5 per cent) between 2010 and 2016. But this masks a reduction in the number of teachers in secondary schools, which fell by 10,800 (4.9 per cent) between 2010 and 2016.</p>

<p>A survey conducted by the National Audit Office (NAO) found that the vast majority of secondary school leaders did not think they had been given enough support by the government to retain high-quality teachers and they thought that cost was a barrier to improving the quality of their workforce.</p>

<p>The NAO also says that DfE initiatives to support the teaching workforce have been ""relatively small scale"", estimating that the department spent £35.7 million in 2016-17 on teacher development and retention, as well as an estimated £34.2 million on schemes aimed at improving teacher quality.</p>

<p>In comparison, in 2013-14, £555 million was spent on training and supporting new teachers.</p>

<p>The study did find, however, that more qualified teachers are returning to state schools, with 14,200 heading back into the classroom last year, up by 1,110 on 2011.</p>

<p>But the report concluded that there were still ""concerning trends"" in secondary schools.</p>

<p>It said: ""Schools are facing real challenges in retaining and developing their teachers, particularly when they are also expected to make significant savings by using staff more efficiently.</p>

<p>""Without a clear and practical integrated workforce and financial approach, supported by good evidence and school engagement, there is a risk that the pressure on teachers will grow, with implications for the sustainability of the workforce.""</p>

<p>Amyas Morse, NAO chief executive, said: ""Schools are facing real challenges in retaining and developing their teachers, with growing pupil numbers and tighter budgets. The trends over time and variation between schools are concerning, and there is a risk that the pressure on teachers will grow.</p>

<p>""Since having enough high-quality teachers is essential to the effective operation of the school system, these are issues that the department needs to address urgently.""</p>

<p>A DfE spokeswoman said there were 15,500 more teachers in schools than in 2010, and ""significant sums"" were being spent on teacher recruitment.</p>

<p>She said: ""We recognise there are challenges facing schools and we are taking significant steps to address them.</p>

<p>""We have established a £75 million fund to support high-quality professional development in those schools where teacher retention is an issue, and we are making it easier to advertise vacancies.</p>

<p>“In addition, we are working with Ofsted to tackle workload and will continue to engage with the profession to better understand the specific challenges and how we can address them.""</p>

<h2>'Scrambling in the dark'</h2>

<p>Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT headteachers’ union, said: “This report is pretty savage but entirely justified.</p>

<p>""As the report says, the government cannot get away from the fact that it does not keep data on local supply and demand and cannot show that its interventions are improving teacher retention.</p>

<p>“As such, the DfE is scrambling around in the dark, wasting money and without a clear plan to tackle recruitment and retention. It’s a national problem. So it needs a national solution.”</p>

<p>Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “It’s vital that we do more to keep teachers in the profession and that means we must address the factors which have too often drained the joy out of teaching in recent years.</p>

<p>“The government’s endless cycle of education reforms, combined with severe underfunding and a high-stakes accountability regime, have placed schools and colleges under intolerable pressure.</p>

<p>""This has resulted in unsustainable workloads at all levels and we desperately need a period of stability free from further reforms.</p>

<p>""Ministers must also address the issue of teachers' pay. It is simply unreasonable of the government to expect more and more of schools while at the same time imposing real-terms pay cuts.""</p>

<p>But speaking exclusively to Tes, the education secretary said that money was not the only thing that matters for schools, highlighting the importance of the government also “having the right strategy”.</p>

<p>Today Ms Greening confirmed details of the long awaited new <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/funding-formula-should-mean-ps3500-every-primary-pupil"">national funding formula</a> for schools. </p>

<p>And the education secretary has used her Tes interview to make clear how proud she is of her record on funding.</p>

<p>She highlighted the <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/schools-get-a-ps13-billion-funding-boost"">additional £1.3 billion she announced in July</a> for schools, found from elsewhere in the DfE budget, and the introduction of the <a href=""https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiblMTrzqTWAhUROsAKHQ2yBEEQFgguMAE&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tes.com%2Fnews%2Fschool-news%2Fbreaking-news%2Fgreening-stands-manifesto-pledge-no-school-will-lose-out-under&usg=AFQjCNHGoVLaUmDrfBwSBomGcaVjkGmEtA"">funding formula</a>, to address the wildly varying levels of funding received by similar schools in different areas.</p>

<p>When challenged about recent heart-rending stories of the effects of the funding squeeze at the chalkface, Ms Greening acknowledged the difficulties schools face.</p>

<p>“I have been a school governor in the past for 14 years, so I do know about the discussions that governing bodies have around how to make best use out of the money that is available, and I know often they are not always easy discussions,” she said.</p>

<p>“But we are putting record levels of funding into our education system; we have now managed to make sure in the final years of the spending review that pupil funding can be maintained in real terms.”</p>

<p>In the past, the “record levels of funding” mantra has caused headteachers’ eyes to roll and a feeling among some that ministers either “don’t get it” or “don’t want to get it”.</p>

<p>“I would never be complacent about the levels of school funding,” Greening retorted.</p>

<p>“What I’m saying is that we all recognise that investment is part of the strategy, but critically, how you then make sure that (a) that gets to the front line, which is what we were doing with the £1.3 billion, and (b) that we have schools that can really get the most out of that investment, that really know what works.”</p>

360877,Angela Rayner outlines 10-point charter for National Education Service ,National Education Union calls for proposal to champion 'well-trained and qualified professionals',"<p>Labour has signalled plans for democratic oversight of schools and emotional support for staff as part of a 10-point charter for a <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-news/corbyn-life-long-training-crucial-economy"">National Education Service</a>.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/angela-rayner-appointed-labours-third-shadow-education-secretary-less"">Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner</a> today outlined more details of the proposed cradle-to-grave education service, which has been a flagship policy of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.</p>

<p>The proposed charter says schools ""should be rooted in their communities, with parents and communities empowered, via appropriate democratic means, to influence change where it is needed and ensure that the education system meets their needs"".</p>

<p>It added that ""the appropriate democratic authority will set, monitor and allocate resources, ensuring that they meet the rights, roles, and responsibilities of individuals and institutions"".</p>

<h2>National Education Service 'lifelong'</h2>

<p>On education staff, it says the service's ""policies and practices, particularly regarding workload, assessment, and inspection, will support the emotional, social and physical well-being of students and staff"".</p>

<p>Ms Rayner this afternoon told the party’s conference in Brighton: ""Our national education service will be lifelong, providing for people at every stage of their life.</p>

<p>""That is our national education service. Not just another structure. Not another new sign on the school gate.”</p>

<p>She criticised the government's national funding formula for schools, and told delegates ""they still won’t meet their promise that funding will go up in real terms over five years"".</p>

<p>She added: ""A Labour government would meet that promise instead: a fairer funding formula, but genuinely fair and properly funded.""</p>

<p>Ms Rayner repeated Labour's pledges to remove the public sector pay cap, invest £8 billion in new school buildings ""where they are needed"" and commit £13 billion to repair the school estate.</p>

<p>She also said that, if she became education secretary, she would allocate £10 million ""to end the scandal of period poverty in our schools"".</p>

<p>The party says it will consult on the principles of the charter across the education sector. The 10 principles are:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Education has intrinsic value in giving all people access to the common body of knowledge we share, and practical value in allowing all to participate fully in our society. These principles shall guide the National Education Service. </li>
	<li>The National Education Service shall provide education that is free at the point of use, available universally and throughout life.   </li>
	<li>The National Education Service provides education for the public good and all providers within the National Education Service shall be bound by the principles of this charter. </li>
	<li>High-quality education is essential to a strong and inclusive society and economy, so the National Education Service shall work alongside the health, sustainability, and industrial policies set by a democratically elected government. </li>
	<li>Every child, and adult, matters, so the National Education Service will be committed to tackling all barriers to learning and providing high-quality education for all. </li>
	<li>All areas of skill and learning deserve respect. The National Education Service will provide all forms of education, integrating academic, technical and other forms of learning within and outside of educational institutions, and treating all with equal respect.</li>
	<li>Educational excellence is best-achieved through collaboration. The National Education Service will be structured to encourage and enhance cooperation across boundaries and sectors.</li>
	<li>The National Education Service shall be accountable to the public, communities, and parents and children that it serves. Schools, colleges, and other public institutions within the National Education Service should be rooted in their communities, with parents and communities empowered, via appropriate democratic means, to influence change where it is needed and ensure that the education system meets their needs. The appropriate democratic authority will set, monitor and allocate resources, ensuring that they meet the rights, roles, and responsibilities of individuals and institutions. </li>
	<li>The National Education Service aspires to the highest standards of excellence and professionalism. Educators and all other staff will be valued as highly-skilled professionals, and appropriate accountability will be balanced against giving genuine freedom of judgement and innovation. The National Education Service shall draw on evidence and international best practice, and provide appropriate professional development and training.</li>
	<li>The National Education Service must have the utmost regard for the wellbeing of learners and educators. Its policies and practices – particularly regarding workload, assessment and inspection – will support the emotional, social and physical wellbeing of students and staff</li>
</ol>

<p>The proposals were welcomed by Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/atl-and-nut-merge-and-form-a-new-education-super-union"">National Education Union (NEU)</a>.</p>

<p>He said: “This charter is a ray of light, illuminating the possibilities for a new education system, after years in which schools and colleges have experienced a narrow curriculum, a punitive system of accountability and a lowering of educational horizons. </p>

<p>“It recognises professionalism. It avoids the language of blame. It commits to the wellbeing of education workers and learners. It pledges to integrate education with social and economic policy, so that schools and colleges are no longer expected to carry most of the burden of transforming lives. It envisages a system restored to democratic control. These principles could fundamentally change for the better our educational system.""</p>

<p>He added that, in the consultation on Labour’s plans, the union would emphasise “the importance of well-trained and qualified professionals, with time and space for continuing their professional development throughout their careers as a key principle, on which NEU would build its vision for education”.</p>

360889,"Teacher training: the gap between school-led and university-led partnerships, and four other findings","Ofsted statistics published this morning also show that the proportion of ""outstanding"" partnerships varies around the country","<p>The much higher proportion of ""outstanding"" school-led partnerships delivering Initial Teacher Education (ITE), compared with university-led partnerships, is highlighted in statistics released this morning.</p>

<p>Ofsted's annual ITE <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/initial-teacher-education-inspections-and-outcomes-as-at-30-june-2017/initial-teacher-education-inspection-statistics-as-at-30-june-2017"">inspection statistics</a> show that 45 per cent of school-led partnerships and 27 per cent of university-led partnerships have received the highest rating.</p>

<p>However, the overall quality of training is described by Ofsted as ""similarly high"" in both school-led partnerships and university-led partnerships.</p>

<p>Ninety-nine per cent of university-led partnerships and 100 per cent of school-led partnerships were judged to be ""good"" or ""outstanding"" after their most recent inspection.</p>

<p>Judgements are made after inspectors observe trainees during training and then watch newly qualified teachers, or former trainees, in the classroom.</p>

<p>Here are four other findings from today's statistics:</p>

<p><strong>1. The proportion of outstanding partnerships has fallen slightly</strong></p>

<p>The proportion of ""outstanding"" partnerships dropped by one percentage point since last year.</p>

<p>However, the proportion of ""good"" partnerships rose by one percentage point, from 65 per cent last year to 66 per cent this year.</p>

<p>Ninety-nine per cent of all partnerships were rated ""good"" or ""outstanding"". This is the same proportion as the end of the previous academic year.</p>

<p><strong>2. All FE partnerships were rated good or outstanding for the first time</strong></p>

<p>All of the six further education partnerships inspected this academic year retained their ""good"" grade.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the University of Essex improved from ""requires improvement"" to ""good"" at its single stage inspection. </p>

<p>This is the first time, since the current inspection cycle started in 2012, that all FE partnerships are ""good"" or ""outstanding"" at their most recent inspection.</p>

<p><strong>3. The two partnerships that require improvement are early years</strong></p>

<p>There were only two partnerships in England that ""required improvement"": early years training at the Manchester Metropolitan University and the University of Sunderland’s early years partnership.</p>

<p>This is the second year of inspections for early years partnerships. So far 17 have been inspected and all but two have been judged to be ""good"" at their most recent inspection.</p>

<p>These two providers have not been allocated any trainees for the early years age phase partnership for the 2017-18 academic year.</p>

<p><strong>4. The proportion of ""outstanding"" partnerships varies around the country</strong></p>

<p>The outcomes of these inspections over the past academic year show that around half of partnerships in each of the South West and London regions were judged to be ""outstanding"" at their most recent inspection.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the East of England had the lowest proportion of ""outstanding"" partnerships – only 5 of the 31 partnerships were rated as ""outstanding"".</p>

<p> </p>

<p>School standards minister Nick Gibb said: “The number of universities and schools engaged in teacher training rated by Ofsted as 'good' or 'outstanding' remains extremely high.</p>

<p>""This will help to ensure all those training to be teachers are able to pursue successful careers as teachers, and are equipped to teach pupils the knowledge and skills they need to fulfil their potential.</p>

<p>""We are continuing to work with the schools and universities to improve teacher training further, including through strengthening professional qualifications.”</p>

361729,"'There are elements to applaud in Justine Greening's approach, but it'll mean little without extra funding'","The DfE has clearly been doing some thinking, but with thousands of schools at risk of going under, we need more money before anything else, writes one headteachers' leader ","<p>The big education headlines from the Conservative conference have mainly been about higher education, but the focus <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/justine-greening-reveals-plans-english-hubs-literacy-early-years-and"">on additional support for early language and literacy is also extremely welcome</a>.</p>

<p>At the NAHT headteachers’ union, we’ve been talking about this for some time.</p>

<p>Our recent report on ""School Readiness"" <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/rise-number-children-not-ready-start-school"">highlighted that an increasing number of children are starting school with poor communication skills</a>. We will wait with interest to see the detail of these plans. </p>

<p>The government knows that education was one of the policy areas where they were most out of step with public opinion during the general election. Nearly a million people <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/750000-voters-switched-support-a-result-school-funding-cuts-survey"">changed their votes on polling day because they didn’t like what the Conservatives were proposing for schools</a> and young people.</p>

<p>This week shows that the government has taken the summer to rethink, because there were elements of the Secretary of State’s address that we ought to welcome.</p>

<p>I’m not interested in the conflict language of whether a policy announcement is or isn’t a U-turn. Politicians need room to adjust their position if they are to serve the country well.</p>

<h2>Justine Greening's proposals</h2>

<p>NAHT has led the calls for the government to take action to address the recruitment and retention crisis in schools and Sunday’s announcement is a welcome step in the right direction.</p>

<p>Justine Greening’s proposals for new investment in tailored support for schools facing the acutest recruitment challenges, alongside new pilot programmes to test loan forgiveness and stretched bursaries are welcome recognition that the current situation is unsustainable.</p>

<p>Leaders in eligible schools will welcome any support that might help them recruit and retain good teachers. However, unless there is concerted effort to improve underlying pay levels, working conditions and the status of the profession, these steps are unlikely to have much impact.</p>

<p>Should these new pilots show early promise, we would urge the government to roll them out to all parts of the country without delay, so that all schools facing staffing challenges might benefit.</p>

<p>Yet it appears that the Treasury continues to unreasonably constrain the efforts of the profession by not backing the DfE with meaningful additional funds, even when faced with overwhelming evidence of need.</p>

<p>Meaningful change will not be achieved without real investment. The chancellor’s speech this morning will need to include an announcement of more investment in schools in order for NAHT and others to feel that our concerns are really being understood in Whitehall.</p>

<p>A long-term commitment to funding schools fully and fairly is now long overdue. We’ve written to him today to that effect.</p>

<h2>Schools in deficit</h2>

<p>The Department for Education’s own data says that roughly a third of all schools are already in deficit. Seven out of 10 NAHT members say that their budgets will be untenable by the end of the next academic year. We can’t wait any longer for the money. Subjects are being dropped, support is being reduced, class sizes are increasing. This will do nothing to improve the equality of opportunity, right across the country, we would all like to see.</p>

<p>Whatever policy announcements you make, you cannot do better than funding education fully and fairly and treating teachers well and paying them properly. Unfortunately, that is not happening at the moment.</p>

<p>What most people in education crave is some stability, a good run of years with no big changes. But you can’t really put that kind of thing in a speech and expect the conference crowd to go wild.</p>

<p>Commendably, Justine Greening’s speech demonstrated that she cares less about exciting a friendly crowd and more about trying to focus on some of the right areas.</p>

<p>All too often, her predecessors have been distracted by eye-catching changes to structure, which become an unnecessary distraction from the pursuit of improvement rather than a part of the overall picture. </p>

<p>The main question now is whether the chancellor will be willing to do what the country knows <a href=""https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/home/gove-names-261-schools-picked-for-2bn-priority-schools-building-programme/8630836.article"">is necessary and find the £2bn a year</a> that schools need as a minimum to stay solvent.</p>

<p>It will take bravery because finding the money is a different approach from now. But, as I say, politicians should not see adjusting a position to do the right thing as a negative. Sure, some will cry U-turn but the profession, governors, parents and children will welcome the news. Spending on education is not a future debt, it is an investment in all our futures. The only winner will be the UK.</p>

<p>Mr Hammond, it’s time to do the right thing.</p>

362581,'Getting parents to engage with their kids' education must become a national priority' ,"Ministers spend billions tinkering with education – but do little to boost parental engagement, says charity director","<p>In my recent conversations with headteachers, one issue has cropped up repeatedly: growing problems with <a href=""http://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/three-ways-involve-parents-school-life-term"">engaging parents in their child’s education.</a> Most people understand that, on some level, parents are an integral part of a child’s education – and this commonsense intuition is supported by evidence.</p>

<p>Professor Charles Desforges, professor of education at the University of Exeter and expert on<a href=""http://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/one-five-parents-do-not-spend-any-time-reading-their-children""> parental engagement</a>, found that parental involvement can account for a huge part of the variance in educational outcomes (up to 30 per cent), significantly more than differences in schools (around 5 per cent).</p>

<p>Yet while the government continues to focus heavily on tinkering with the education system, spending huge amounts of money overturning school structures, changing exams and tweaking performance measures in pursuit of better outcomes, the world of policy and research pays precious little attention to driving evidence-based practice in meaningful parental engagement. Hence, we have little in the way of robust, longitudinal studies showing what works and what doesn’t in this regard.</p>

<p>This doesn’t mean, however, that school leaders should shy away from talking about the impact of parenting and looking at what they can do to help parents work better with their children at home. We do have some indications of best practice, such as Ofsted’s 2011 review of <a href=""http://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/make-friends-your-pupils-parents-psychologist-tells-teachers"">parental engagement, </a>that show how schools have varying degrees of success when tackling this difficult issue. Too often, it is the pupils in greatest need of support who receive the least support at home.</p>

<p>We focus on the importance of <a href=""http://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/current-transition-system-asks-too-much-our-vulnerable-pupils-and"">transition from primary to secondary phases for pupils</a>, but there is also a need to consider the disengagement that can occur parentally as well.</p>

<h2>Parents 'bearing scars'</h2>

<p>One issue is that, almost exclusively for secondaries, some parents bear the scars of their own negative experiences of secondary education. In some cases, I have heard of parents actually refusing to cross the school threshold after their experience there  – even when the school is an entirely new building (and sometimes even has a new name).</p>

<p>At primary level, while parents do tend to be much more engaged than they are in secondaries, many are struggling with the challenge of a tougher new curriculum. Heads have fed back to us about parents having difficulties with the demands of literacy in Year 5 and numeracy in Year 3.</p>

<p>Engagement also extends to parents' choices prior to their children starting school. Heads in schools with early years settings are increasingly reporting declining language skills at age 3, with the interference of mobile telephony and tablets impacting on language acquisition and oracy in those crucial formative years.</p>

<p>The issue of parental engagement is not unique to the North East. It needs to become a national priority.</p>

<p>All parents need to see education as the key to a bright future for their children, not as something to be feared or ignored. In the North East, we have some positive initiatives, such as the Read North East campaign, which has brought a range of literacy-based organisations, Schools NorthEast and the National Literacy Trust together to focus initiatives to get parents, particularly in deprived communities, to read with their children more.</p>

<p>However, schemes like this are not enough on their own. Greater focus is needed in this area to better distil and disseminate adoptable and evidence-based practice across the system to enable those crucial partnerships between schools and parents.</p>

362776,Ofsted: Why reading for fun is being cut and 6 other curriculum findings ,The Ofsted chief inspector says that schools have inadvertently come to think of testing as the same thing as the curriculum in its entirety,"<p>Schools have inadvertently merged the concepts of testing and curriculum, so that they now mean the same things, the <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/ofsted-0"">Ofsted</a> chief inspector has said.</p>

<p>Ms Spielman chose to review the curriculum as her first priority as chief inspector. Her <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/pupils-losing-out-schools-prepare-gcse-early-says-ofsted"">comments on the curriculum</a>, published this morning, reveal her “striking” conclusion that there is: “little debate or reflection about the curriculum in most schools”.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/hmcis-commentary-october-2017"">research commissioned by Ofsted</a> found that, in many cases, preparing for tests was cutting into children’s learning time.</p>

<p>“Exams should exist in the service of the curriculum rather than the other way round,” she said.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Which pupils are most affected?</strong></p>

<p>A: When working with lower-achieving pupils in particular, she said, schools tended to narrow the curriculum down to subjects that would count towards league-table scores, at the expense of those subjects that might provide broader knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>Q: And which subjects are most affected by this focus on tests?</strong></p>

<p>A: She criticised schools that reduced key stage 3 to two rather than three years, so as to focus on <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/gcse"">GCSE</a> courses.</p>

<p>“This inevitably means that a considerable number of pupils will be experiencing only two years of study before dropping, for example, history or geography or a language, possibly never to study these subjects again,” she said. “And for most children, the end of key stage 3 is the last time they will take art, music, drama or design and technology.”</p>

<p><strong>Q: Why has this happened?</strong></p>

<p>A: “It seems unlikely that any school has prioritised testing over the curriculum as a deliberate choice,” she said. “It is likely that, in some quarters, testing has come inadvertently to mean the curriculum in its entirety.</p>

<p>“If it is true that curriculum knowledge has weakened across the sector over time, it would explain why there has been a merging of the concepts of testing and the curriculum.”</p>

<p><strong>Q: Is this only a problem for secondary schools?</strong></p>

<p>A: No. Ms Spielman said that an excessive focus on key stage 2 testing was cutting into pupils’ learning time in primary. Around half of the 163 parents questioned by Ofsted believed that test preparation had reduced the teaching time available for other foundation subjects, or for reading for pleasure.</p>

<p><strong>Q: And what did she say about cross-curricular skills?</strong></p>

<p>A: Many schools, she said, focused on teaching “skills”, without defining what those skills were.</p>

<p>“The idea of ‘skills’ was liberally used in many contexts,” she said. “Very rarely was it clear whether the meaning was subject-specific, for example reading skills...<br />
<br />
“There were many other examples of terms where the meaning was woolly, such as 'progression', 'enrichment', 'questioning' and 'repetition'.”</p>

<p><strong>Q: What could help improve curriculum planning?</strong></p>

<p>A: “School leaders and inspectors discussed the timetable in each school,” she said. “The timetable is important. It is, however, not the curriculum.<br />
<br />
“Apart from the timetable, there was an absence of other tangible reference points to get to grips with the complex business of curriculum planning. It was evident from these conversations that took place between inspectors and school leaders that there is a lack of clarity around the language of the curriculum.”</p>

<p>In particular, primary-school leaders said that they were finding it increasingly difficult to recruit staff who could design a curriculum. Some headteachers told Ofsted that teacher training was currently too focused on teaching to English and maths tests.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What happens now?</strong></p>

<p>A: This is the first phase of her curriculum review and included research visits to 40 schools, as well as a review of inspection reports, and discussions with headteachers and parents.</p>

<p>The findings issued today are preliminary and have only “begun to scratch the surface of this complex area”.</p>

<p>The full findings will be published in late spring 2018.</p>

362830,Bursaries for primary teacher trainees to end next year,But there are rises for biology and English teachers – and new retention payments for maths teachers,"<p>There will be no bursaries for students to train as primary teachers next year, the Department for Education has announced.</p>

<p>The £3,000 currently available for primary teacher trainees with a First or PhD to train as a teacher is being discontinued, <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/funding-initial-teacher-training-itt-academic-year-2018-to-19"">DfE guidance</a> says.</p>

<p>But bursaries for students wanting to train as biology and English teachers next year have increased dramatically.</p>

<p>A would-be biology teacher can get £26,000 to train as a teacher next year, if they have a First, 2:1 or 2:2 degree.</p>

<p>This is up from the £15,000 bursary a biology trainee could receive this year if they have a First, the £12,000 if they have a 2:1 or the £10,000 offered if they have a 2:2.</p>

<p>Bursaries for English teachers have also jumped from £9,000 for those with First or 2:1 degrees in the current academic year to £15,000 next year – a bursary that will be open to those with 2:2 degrees as well.</p>

<p>Physics bursaries are still among the highest but have dropped from a top rate of £30,000 in 2017-18 to £26,000 in 2018-19.</p>

<p>Similarly, the physics scholarship – available from professional bodies – will drop from £30,000 to £28,000.</p>

<p>Maths trainees can now get up to £35,000 – but not in one go. The government has put in place an up-front bursary of £20,000, or scholarship of £22,000, with two further “early career payments” available as retention incentives.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/650868/Mathematics_early-career_payments-final.pdf"">Under this scheme</a>, eligible maths teachers will get £5,000 in each of their third and fifth year of teaching, if they have taught in a state-funded school in England since completing their ITT course. These payments will rise to £7,500 each in selected local authorities.</p>

<p>It comes after criticism that large bursaries are not helping to <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/bribing-trainee-teachers-damages-profession-says-university-vice"">retain teachers in the profession</a>.</p>

<p>James Noble-Rogers, executive director of the Universities Council for the Education of Teachers, said: “I think it is a mistake to get rid of bursaries for primary.</p>

<p>""I think we need to encourage the best people into teacher training and it helps to get a balance of people if people are not put off for financial reasons. I also think there is a supply problem. I think the government is underestimating the need for new primary trainees.”</p>

<p>The amount on offer for primary trainees has declined in recent years. In 2015, primary trainees with a First could get a £9,000 bursary and those with a 2:1 could get £4,000.</p>

<p>In September 2016, the <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/recruitment-fears-increase-number-teacher-trainees-drops-almost-7"">number of primary teachers</a> placed on courses dropped more than 2,000 compared to the previous year.</p>

<p>And statistics published by the DfE earlier this year revealed that <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/teacher-shortage-crisis-deepens-new-dfe-figures-show"">teacher vacancy rates</a> rose in 2016.</p>

<p>Nick Gibb, minister for school standards, said: ""Bursaries have enabled thousands of talented people to become teachers. They continue to incentivise applications in the core subjects that equip pupils with the knowledge and skills they need to fulfil their potential.</p>

<p>“Incentives are targeted to ensure teachers are recruited where they are needed most. From 2018, we are increasing funding across all high priority subjects and we will continue to offer generous bursaries and grant funding to ensure teaching remains an attractive profession for top graduates.”</p>

363439,Mine of information,Documenting what you have taught and how well pupils have understood it will enable you to tailor future lessons to enhance learning. James Pembroke has put together a beginner’s guide to being a data-savvy teacher,"<p>You've probably heard a few scare stories about data. Yet, used well – and only when needed – data can be among a teacher’s most powerful tools.</p>

<p>Tales of data-related woe arose amid the chaos that surrounded the removal of levels (which had been in place for 26 years) in 2014. Since then, we have seen a shift – welcomed by many teachers – away from collecting data for the purposes of accountability (“What do we need for Ofsted?”) towards using data to support teaching and learning (“What has been taught and how well have pupils understood it?”).</p>

<p>So, in light of this change in approach, it's important to differentiate between the types of data you are likely to be confronted with and then consider how best to make use of them in the classroom.</p>

<h2>Mix of assessment</h2>

<p>Most schools will use a mix of teacher assessment and tests, some of which will be useful, others less so. Teacher assessment may simply take the form of an overall summative judgement, such as “emerging”, which is of very little value. One key reason for the removal of levels was that they were broad, best-fit indicators that told us almost nothing about what pupils could and couldn’t do. Some new approaches are no different and should not be relied upon.</p>

<p>Of far more use is tracking against key objectives in which individual learning maps are created that show gaps in, and depth of, learning. This will provide valuable detail that can inform your teaching. Regular testing will also provide useful information on what pupils do and don’t know.</p>

<p>Question-level analysis highlights gaps, areas for support and opportunities to stretch children further. Plotting pupils’ test scores over time reveals dips and provides a useful progress measure, while plotting test scores in one subject against another identifies pupils with inconsistent results. Test scores can also be plotted against teacher assessments in order to spot discrepancies.</p>

<h2>Identify specific groups</h2>

<p>Ideally, test scores should be captured in your tracking systems so they can help to inform teacher assessment and be included in key reports to show performance of pupil groups. A word of warning, though: while tests are undeniably useful, they only represent a pupil’s attainment on one particular day and may not reflect their overall ability.</p>

<p>It is vital that key contextual information is available to teachers so that they can easily identify specific groups of students, such as disadvantaged pupils and those with SEND, and track their knowledge gaps and progress. Awareness of prior attainment is also essential as it gives an indication of future attainment.</p>

<p>Information can be a powerful tool when used correctly but it is easily skewed if used for multiple purposes. A focus on accountability or performance management can distort data and render it unreliable. And there is a balance to be struck between what is useful and what adds to your workload. Spending your life ticking boxes is counterproductive.</p>

<p>Remember the mantra: do what has the most impact. Your time is best spent teaching.</p>

363466,How to support learners with SEND,"Don’t leave interventions to your teaching assistant – take time to get to know children with additional educational needs, says Nancy Gedge","<p>Starting your first job as a teacher is exciting but it can also be intimidating, especially where special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) are concerned. But it is important to remember, as it says in the SEND Code of Practice, that every teacher is a teacher of special needs. That means it is you who is responsible for the children with SEND in your class: not the special educational needs coordinator (Sendco), not the teaching assistant; you.</p>

<p>Teaching children with SEND is a great responsibility – and often a great joy – and part of the work will include interventions. These are shorter lessons, mostly delivered by teaching assistants, most commonly in the areas of literacy and numeracy.</p>

<p>Interventions can make a huge difference – and they can also be a complete waste of time – so it’s important to think carefully about them. Here are some simple dos and don’ts to make sure your interventions are worthwhile.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Do</strong> take some time to get to know your pupils before sending them out of class with someone else. In some schools, the Sendco will coordinate interventions, in others it will be the class teacher. Either way, time spent getting to know the children will help you to decide who needs intervention and who doesn’t.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Don’</strong>t rely only on second-hand information. Talk to the TAs and previous teachers to get a sense of what a student’s difficulties might be, but don’t forget to bring their views and school tracking data together with what you know – and that is best done through teaching them yourself.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Do</strong> use intervention materials that have a good evidence base for success. You can find evidence-based materials for literacy interventions at bit.ly/DyslexiaWhatWorks and, more generally, at bit.ly/SENDtoolkit.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Don’t </strong>feel that you have to reorganise intervention provision in your school. This is a job for Sendcos and senior leaders. Your job is to make use of what you have in school in the interests of your students.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Do</strong> utilise the expertise of teaching assistants. If you find yourself with an experienced TA, this is great news. They can help you with all manner of things related and unrelated to intervention (they will know where everything is kept and who everyone is).</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Don’t</strong> leave students with SEND to the TA. Check in every once in a while, just to see how your children are getting on. This will not only help them to feel that they are part of the class but will also allow you to monitor progress and behaviour. You might even want to teach the intervention group yourself every so often, just to keep them on their toes, while you let the TA look after the class.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Do</strong> keep records of who is doing what, with whom, when and where.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Don’t</strong> let an intervention run on regardless. If a child has been in an intervention for any length of time, keep a watchful eye on their progress. If they aren’t making any, or not enough, then you need to analyse what is going wrong and think about referring them to the Sendco for further help. Remember, interventions are part of the “graduated approach” (bit.ly/Graduated Approach) to SEND provision.</p>

","<p>Starting your first job as a teacher is exciting but it can also be intimidating, especially where special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) are concerned. But it is important to remember, as it says in the SEND Code of Practice, that every teacher is a teacher of special needs. That means it is you who is responsible for the children with SEND in your class: not the special educational needs coordinator (Sendco), not the teaching assistant; you.</p>

364483,Praising children for being smart 'encourages cheating',"Children who are made to feel clever are more likely to cheat, research finds","<p>Telling children as young as 3 that they are clever motivates them to cheat in test situations, according to research.</p>

<p>The study, carried out by an international team of researchers, split 150 three-year-olds and 150 five-year-olds into three groups. </p>

<p>In one group, children were given no praise, in another they were praised for their performance, and the remainder were told they were intelligent.</p>

<p>The children were given six attempts at guessing whether a playing card held by a researcher was higher or lower than the number six. They were told they would win a prize if they guessed correctly at least three times.</p>

<p>The odds were stacked against them, with the game rigged so that the children won on their first two attempts but lost the next three in succession. On the final attempt, the children were left alone in the room for one minute, with a hidden camera recording whether or not they cheated by leaning over the barrier or getting out of their chair to look at the card.</p>

<p>Sixty per cent of the children who had been told they were smart went on to cheat, compared with 41 per cent of those who had been praised for their performance and 40 per cent of the children who were given no praise.</p>

<p>However, boys were far more likely to cheat than girls. Among the children who were told they were smart, 68 per cent of boys cheated compared with 52 per cent of girls. The paper does not discuss why this was the case.</p>

<p>Simply praising young children without paying careful attention to the choice of words used could have “unintended consequences”, warned the researchers, who hailed from the University of California San Diego, the University of Toronto, and Hangzhou Normal University in China. The study was carried out in eastern China.</p>

<p>“Telling children that they are smart, a form of ability praise, may have the opposite effect by motivating them to cheat to appear smarter,"" the researchers said.</p>

<p>They added: “Ability praise may have motivated children to cheat in order to uphold the positive trait assessment or the reputation of being smart.”</p>

<p><a href=""http://nebula.wsimg.com/7d86e9877ed1cba2a9d99ca148ddda03?AccessKeyId=039E3584B0C0E98358E6&disposition=0&alloworigin=1"">Their findings</a>, recently published in the Psychological Science journal, demonstrated that “ability praise can promote cheating in young children”.</p>

<p>Co-author Dr Lee, from the Eric Jackman Institute of Child Study, University of Toronto, told <em>Tes</em>: “The most surprising about the findings to me is that children as young as 3 years of age are already sensitive to the linguistic differences between the smart praise (you are so smart) and the behavioral praise (you did very well this time), and behave accordingly.</p>

<p>""Such differences are really subtle and adults often find them undisguisable and they use them interchangeably when praising children.”</p>

<p>He commented that the higher proportion of boys cheating was due to them having “poorer inhibitory abilities than girls”.</p>

<p>The new research builds on previous studies by <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/weekend-read-growth-mindset-new-learning-styles"">Professor Carol Dweck</a>, a psychologist at Stanford University, who has demonstrated that praising a child’s innate ability instead of their effort or a particular behaviour can lower their appetite for learning and ability to deal with setbacks.</p>

<p>“What we should be trying to do is help young people understand what’s out there,” said Ms Curnock Cook speaking at the Institute of Ideas’ Battle of Ideas festival today. “Most young people - even those who have parents in professional occupations - have no idea what their parents do every day in whatever job they’re doing. </p>

<p>“And young people from more disadvantaged background may not have people in their immediate circle who has a job.</p>

<p>Ms Curnock Cook, who is now an independent educationalist, added that the new technical qualifications, <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/new-t-levels-replace-thousands-post-16-vocational-qualifications"">the T levels</a>, would include training in transport and logistics but asked how would the average 16-year-old know they want to go into transport and logistics rather than engineering, construction or digital. She added that having some work experience was a good idea but wanted pupils to learn about wider opportunities.</p>

<p>“If we have that careers education, that is really educating them about what is out there rather than just trying to make them work ready, having that career context might be really helpful for them, in motivating them and give them some context… and showing them that getting those grades really does matter,” she added.</p>

365494,Tes talks to… Dr Jessie Ricketts,"Oral language is key to reading, says this literacy expert. But, she tells Kate Townshend, the subject is sorely neglected in schools – and pupils could be missing out on progression as a result","<p>Our primary reading curriculum is heralded internationally as being outstanding – and yet 10 to 20 per cent of secondary pupils cannot read well enough to access the curriculum,” states Dr Jessie Ricketts, director of the Language and Reading Acquisition (LARA) research lab at Royal Holloway, University of London.</p>

<p>That may sound like a criticism of primary teachers, but she stresses that is not the case.</p>

<p>“There is an expectation that at the end of primary school, pupils will be able to read well and an assumption that teaching pupils to read is the job of primary teachers,” she explains. “Primary teachers are clearly doing a fantastic job – look at performance on the phonics screening check, for example – but, nonetheless, there are some pupils who, despite being exposed to excellent teaching, continue to struggle with reading.</p>

<p>That support will be welcomed by primary teachers, who often get scapegoated by secondary teachers for a student’s poor reading ability, but where should the blame lie?</p>

<p>“Well, there are likely to be many explanations. For example, in some children reading difficulties will be due to underlying language difficulties, or reflect a lack of reading experience.”</p>

<p>The impact on the education outcomes of these struggling students is stark, she adds.</p>

<p>“My research shows that vocabulary and reading abilities vary enormously in secondary pupils – from some who can read very few, if any, words at all to others reading with comprehension at adult levels,” she explains. “This variation poses enormous challenges to accessing the curriculum. Adolescent poor readers have been trying and failing to read successfully for many years, which likely has implications for self-esteem and engagement with education.”</p>

<p>The solution to this issue is complex, she says: the current evidence is patchy when it comes to the best way to support struggling readers in secondary schools. But her work at the LARA lab does offer some insight into one way in which primary and secondary teaching can be optimised to help these persistently struggling readers.</p>

<p>“I cannot underline the importance of oral language for reading enough,” she explains. “In my view it doesn’t make sense to think about one without the other and this is at the core of our work at the LARA lab,” she says.</p>

<h2>More research required</h2>

<p>As you might imagine, oral vocabulary – what an individual knows about words that are spoken – is particularly important for comprehension. You can’t understand what you’re reading unless you understand the words that are making it up – but Ricketts thinks that spoken language is also likely to play a part in children’s ability to decode the words they read in the first place.</p>

<p>“Oral vocabulary drives reading comprehension but I’ve also been interested in understanding how vocabulary knowledge is important for the reading of words,” she explains. “This area of research is not as well established, but there is evidence that oral vocabulary, as well as phonology, supports word reading.</p>

<p>“Let’s imagine that a five-year-old child is trying to read the word ‘friend’. If they sound out each letter on the basis of knowledge of how these letters are usually pronounced, they will end up with something like ‘free-end’ or ‘fry-end’. Now that is not quite correct but it is a pretty good partial decoding attempt. If our reader realises that ‘free-end’ is not a word that they know but they do know the very similar word ‘friend’ then they can use this knowledge to arrive at an accurate pronunciation.”</p>

<p>Pleasingly, there’s a certain amount of karmic justice at work here too, because while vocabulary might play an important part in children learning to read in the first place, once they actually are reading, this debt to spoken language is likely to be repaid.</p>

<p>“Once children learn to read, reading abilities impact on vocabulary and the relationship becomes reciprocal,” says Ricketts. “We are still working out the precise nature of this reciprocity as part of my Vocabulary and Reading in Secondary Schools (VaRiSS) project, following 200 pupils through key stage 3. But, so far, there seems to be a close relationship between oral vocabulary and reading in late childhood/early adolescence and it seems to get closer as children move through the school system.”</p>

<p><img height=""844"" width=""1500"" class=""media-element file-default img-responsive"" typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""http://tes.com/sites/default/files/tes031117_36_inline.jpg"" alt="""" /></p>

<p> </p>

<p>The reason for this at first seems relatively straightforward. “Once children can read, reading provides opportunities for vocabulary learning,” says Ricketts. “If a child encounters a new word in text, they can use the context and their knowledge to infer the meaning of a word. We know that children can do this and it seems to be an important driver of vocabulary growth, at least in the primary years.</p>

<p>“But I am also interested in another way that reading may promote vocabulary knowledge. I find it really difficult to learn new names – especially unfamiliar ones – unless I have seen them written down. In my experiences of being in schools, I’ve noticed that teachers often write words on the board when they are describing them.</p>

<p>“There’s long-standing evidence showing that presenting children and adults with visual word forms helps them to learn new spoken-word forms. I’ve gone on to show in a number of studies – along with colleagues – that children are more likely to learn the meanings of new words, if these words are taught with the visual form available.”</p>

<p>This is one way then that teachers can give their pupils a headstart when it comes to extending their spoken language, but what else should we be doing?</p>

<p>“Explicit teaching of vocabulary is really important and is typically more effective than when children learn vocabulary incidentally by listening to spoken language or reading,” explains Ricketts. “We should aim for a combination of this and equipping pupils with the skills to learn new words independently.</p>

<p>“Also, there is an important distinction to be made between subject-specific vocabulary and vocabulary that operates across the curriculum. Both are important – pupils need to know words like photosynthesis but also words like analyse, evaluate and so on. In secondary schools, I think there can be an added challenge because subjects are taught separately by different teams. I am working with teachers to establish the words that are essential for educational success. These will, of course, vary and change but there are some words that will always be important.”</p>

<h2>'A very tall order'</h2>

<p>Ricketts, though, is sympathetic to some of the more esoteric problems teachers face when it comes to vocabulary, particularly the limitations that can occur because of children’s life experiences – or lack of them.</p>

<p>“Children enter the school system with enormous disparities in vocabulary knowledge and it is a very tall order to expect teachers to compensate for this. I suspect trips can be really useful here when they are possible, going to the local mosque to support religious education and associated vocabulary, or being able to actively engage with the items that they are learning about in a cookery lesson,” she says.</p>

<p>Ricketts’ future research promises to shed more light on how we can specifically help this group of students.</p>

<p>“My research has also focused on whether we can harness children’s reading skills to compensate for poor oral vocabulary. I’m interested in this because there are vulnerable children out there who seem to have better word-reading abilities than you would expect, on the basis of their oral vocabulary knowledge. In new projects we are also investigating approaches to increasing the amount of reading that children do, and how we can maximise the extent to which children learn new words while they are reading.”</p>

<p>It’s crucial Ricketts gets this right, she stresses, as it underpins everything else.</p>

<p>“We know children with better language abilities go on to have better educational and socioemotional outcomes.”</p>

<p>Some residential special schools focus on wellbeing and therapeutic support of their pupils at the expense of educational progress, according to a <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/657418/Good_intentions_good_enough_-_a_review_of_residential_special_schools_and_colleges.pdf"">review of residential special schools and colleges.</a></p>

<p>And adversarial relationships between local authorities (LAs) and providers leave young people “caught in the middle” and can cause delays in them receiving the right support, it found.</p>

<p>Currently, there are around 6,000 children educated in 334 residential special schools and colleges in the state, non-maintained and independent sectors.</p>

<p>And today’s review, <em>Good Intentions, Good Enough?</em>, written by Dame Christine Lenehan and Mark Geraghty, says: “Some young people can be held back by a lack of ambition for what they can achieve. Preparation for adulthood can suffer because of this, and some LAs feel outcomes are not as good as they should be.</p>

<p>“This lack of ambition can remain unchallenged thanks to inadequate monitoring of placements by some LAs, with annual reviews regularly going unattended.”</p>

<h2>'Weak networks'</h2>

<p>It concludes: “Some residential special schools seemed professionally isolated, with weak networks inhibiting the sharing of good practice and learning from bad practice.</p>

<p>""Experiences and outcomes for these children and young people are too often not as good as they should be.""  </p>

<p>The review calls for young people with <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/send"">SEND</a> to get the services and support they need in their local community. </p>

<p>It also says that local areas should plan and commission provision strategically, and ensure that accountability systems enable children to achieve the best possible outcomes.</p>

<p>Today's review also recommended that the Department for Education create a national leadership board for children and young people with high needs.</p>

<p>In a response to the review, <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/657419/SoS_letter.pdf"">education secretary Justine Greening wrote</a>: “It is now time to increase our focus on the quality of the support that these children and young people receive. </p>

<p>“This is particularly important for the children and young people in residential special schools and colleges, who are some of the most vulnerable in our society.”</p>

<p>Ms Greening has:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Set up a national leadership board for children and young people with high needs;</li>
	<li>Published updated guidance for local authorities on their duty to visit children and young people in long-term residential settings;</li>
	<li>Published a new resource setting out evidence on effective approaches for these children.<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<p>She has added that a fuller response will be made next year.</p>

But teaching has driven him to the point where his kids can send him into a meltdown. Few could survive the pressures of life at the chalkface for long ,"<p>It really feels like I barely see my husband. As a full-time classroom science teacher in one of the ‘tougher’ comprehensives of East London, and a dad of three children, he has his work cut out.</p>

<p>Every weekday morning, he rises at 4.30am to prepare his classes and is off to work by 6.30am.</p>

<p>He returns at 5.30pm to pick up our three children from their various locations, takes them home and prepares the tea before I stumble through the door from my office job in town.</p>

<p>He’s back to work with marking and more prep from 8pm to 9pm, and he usually flops to sleep in his clothes without saying goodnight.</p>

<p>After five days of this relentless cycle, he takes a ‘break’ on Saturday morning – alone – then works solidly from 12 noon to 6pm. When he joins us for dinner after this unpaid graft, he is<a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/i-sat-there-duty-hoping-none-50-odd-girls-would-have-emergency-i""> often pale, distinctly unhealthy-looking and lacking all spark</a>. Sunday is largely rest day, which he devotes to chores, spending time with the kids and – just for good measure – a nice dose of last-minute marking.</p>

<p>These Sundays surrounded by our lovely but demanding children can drive him to his limit sometimes. He is by far the calmest and most patient person I have ever met, but a toddler crying about their incorrectly distributed baked beans can send a tired-out teacher-dad into meltdown, too. He doesn’t take it out on us, but I know my husband’s ‘fury eyebrows’ reflect deep inner-turmoil.</p>

<p>The cycle goes on and on and on until the holidays arrive, when he frets and panics about whether he will have enough days away from childcare to do all the extra work he needs to do to cope. Everything is tainted by the pressures of work. Any fun and pleasure in teaching or parenting has been taken away.</p>

<p>We only planned one family weekend away this term and that was trashed by the announcement that he would be enduring a Monday morning pre-Ofsted lesson observation. He almost didn’t make it to his son’s birthday tea because of a last-minute demand to <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/garbage-garbage-out-reality-school-data"">log a bunch of data on some system</a>, somewhere. He had already logged the data somewhere else, but that was apparently not enough. I’d fly into a rage and resign if my employer gave me a data-entry task for no apparent reason.</p>

<p>As a devoted wife, I try to be supportive and to step in with most of the chores. But, I’m sorry to say, I am not one of those wives without ego, drive, ambitions of my own, and it is hard not to resent this regime. It can be lonely when you spend more time washing someone’s dirty work shirts than you do with the person themselves. I spend a lot of my time worrying about him, but when I see him, I’m sort of angry at him for his constant absence. This unending programme is punishing my husband and his family.</p>

<p>Any politician questioning why teachers adopt these work regimens (and I know my husband’s is not a patch on many other teachers’ and managers’) hasn’t got a clue what is going on. Sometimes it is not possible to work any ‘smarter’.</p>

<p>The key issues leading to this marathon of prep are thus, in our case: behaviour is such an issue that each class must be meticulously planned; winging it is simply not an option.</p>

<p>Resources and pre-prepared materials are scant in the school. And although the classes are setted, the level of differentiation required in each class is such that he is effectively a private tutor for each of the 20 students, in some cases.</p>

<p>Until recently, my husband was a supply teacher – in an attempt to bring his workload down – and he saw classes that had seen four or five changes of science teacher in the space of a year. Recruitment of permanent and reliable staff in some subjects is proving impossible.</p>

<p>And it is desperately unfair on pupils who feel increasingly unloved and disillusioned by school. How would you feel about learning, and your capacity to learn, if literally no one wanted to teach you?</p>

<p>But is it any wonder the teachers leave? There are <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/teaching-one-most-stressful-jobs-britain"">few who have the constitution</a> to sustain this.</p>

367509,Insolvency regime leaves big questions unanswered,"New law will protect students’ learning if a college fails, but it could also dampen lender appetite and hinder the recruitment of quality governors, warns Jo Wright","<p>Shortly before the general election, the government introduced a new statutory insolvency regime for the FE sector, in the shape of the Technical and Further Education Act 2017. Although intended for implementation ahead of the 2018-19 academic year, the process could be delayed if the rules and regulations required to support it do not come into force in time.</p>

<p>The act offers a clear insolvency framework as an option for colleges facing financial difficulty. It also recognises the complex and delicate stakeholder balance between the interests of creditors and the duty to provide for and protect learners, as well as the need to reduce the taxpayer burden and prove value for money for ongoing investment.</p>

<p>The new insolvency regime is closely aligned with the Insolvency Act, applicable to corporate entities. However, it specifically provides for the making of an education administration order by the court, on application by the secretary of state. Therefore, although the more traditional insolvency processes, such as administration and company voluntary arrangement, will also be available, in practical terms the new special education administration (SEA) order route will prevail. Crucially, the “special” objective of the SEA is to protect students by minimising disruption to studies, should a college enter formal insolvency.</p>

<p>On one hand, having a clear insolvency regime for FE colleges and sixth forms is a positive, but it leaves some big unanswered questions. Firstly, what will be the impact for governors now that the Company Directors Disqualification Act applies to them? Some will consider this an alarming risk, particularly given the voluntary capacity in which they act, unlike company directors.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen how the ability to recruit quality governors in the future will be affected by this. Our experience at De Novo Advisory is that this area is becoming increasingly problematic, at a time when lenders and funders also have rising expectations about the quality of leadership and governance, as a key ingredient to forward support.</p>

<h2>Loss of appetite?</h2>

<p>Another key unknown is the effect of the legislation on lender appetite. The insolvency regime reduces their power and control; for example, enabling their property, rights and liabilities to be transferred to another FE provider without their consent.</p>

<p>My company has regular dialogue with FE lenders as part of its stakeholder management remit on an array of assignments. No lender wants to find itself in a worse position, and undoubtedly this is a risk that is actively being considered across lender portfolios.</p>

<p>Finally, the position of pensions remains unclear, which, given the potentially huge claims that could crystallise in an insolvency, adds to the uncertainty.</p>

<p>The government has made it clear that learning protection is the priority when dealing with FE insolvency. It is not the first time that government has created a special administration regime; similar arrangements exist where the need to manage the financial health of an organisation is balanced with the provision of a public service, such as the NHS.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, the longer-term consequences of this new regime for lender appetite and colleges’ ability to attract and retain quality governors is unknown.</p>

<p>The current lack of visibility on the rules and regulations underpinning the regime adds to the uncertainties. Colleges are already facing strong headwinds and financial scrutiny, as the sector funding crisis and ongoing reforms continue to have an impact.</p>

<p>The FE sector makes a vital contribution to increasing opportunities for young people, businesses and the future economic success of the UK. Clarity over what happens next is the least it deserves.</p>

","<p>Shortly before the general election, the government introduced a new statutory insolvency regime for the FE sector, in the shape of the Technical and Further Education Act 2017. Although intended for implementation ahead of the 2018-19 academic year, the process could be delayed if the rules and regulations required to support it do not come into force in time.</p>

367554,A ‘double-edged sword’ for heads,"Leaders’ new powers could be damaging, say directors","<p>The education director in Scotland’s biggest local authority has warned that heads refusing to take teachers on compulsory transfers is a “double-edged sword”.</p>

<p>Teachers can currently be transferred to another school in the same council if they become surplus to requirements because of a falling roll – or the curriculum in their school changing. Sometimes staff might also request a transfer if, for example, they move house and want to teach closer to home.</p>

<p>However, education secretary John Swinney recently revealed, as part of the government plans to give more power and money directly to headteachers, that he intended to give them the ability to select their own staff teams, including the right to refuse to take staff on compulsory transfer.</p>

<p>The consultation on the new Education Bill, published this month, reiterates the intention to give heads the right to refuse to accept staff who are being redeployed.</p>

<p>However, Glasgow education director Maureen McKenna – who is also president of the education directors’ body ADES – has warned that the policy shift could have an “unintended consequence”. While freeing up headteachers to choose their own staff, she said, it could also lead to schools where the curriculum is “rigidly” shaped “around the current staff group” because teachers are less likely to move.</p>

<p>In a school where the pupil roll fell, headteachers could find themselves “not able to reduce the staff budget”, she added.</p>

<p>Speaking at the ADES annual conference in Cumbernauld last week, Ms McKenna added: “Where is the flexibility there – and how does that meet the needs of every child? I don’t believe that is the policy intention, but it could be an unintended consequence.”</p>

<h2>‘No malevolence’</h2>

<p>In a question-and-answer session with Mr Swinney at the event, Jim Wilson, Glasgow City Council’s head of service and quality improvement for north west, said another “unintended consequence” of empowering headteachers could be that no one has a “holistic view” of school staffing.</p>

<p>One Glasgow primary has recently been close to sending pupils home because of staff absences, he said. All senior management were having to take classes, and assemblies were being held to give teachers their entitlement to non-class contact time.</p>

<p>However, the authority has been able to redistribute teachers from a neighbouring school, which was overstaffed. If this power was at headteacher level, it would be “much more difficult to have that movement in the system”, Mr Wilson said.</p>

<p>Mr Swinney said councils would continue to have an overview of staffing because they would remain the employers. He had no intention of creating separate payrolls in each of Scotland’s 2,500 schools.</p>

<p>“There has been a lot said about the malevolence of my agenda, but that is something I will not impose on you,” he told the education directors, adding that he had no wish to create “isolated silos of individual schools” and that the whole point of bringing councils together in six “regional improvement collaboratives” – an idea quickly taking shape after being announced earlier this year – is that practice and experience can be shared.</p>

<p><img height=""656"" width=""1000"" class=""media-element file-default img-responsive"" typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""http://tes.com/sites/default/files/tess241117_08_stats.png"" alt="""" /></p>

<p> </p>

<p>The government consultation on the new Education Bill, entitled Empowering Schools, states that, while headteachers might be obliged to consider staff being redeployed in the authority when filling a vacancy, “they should not be obliged to select them if they are not the best fit for the post”.</p>

<p>It adds: “Ultimately, a headteacher must be able to select the team with whom they work.”</p>

<p>However, it also states that “it will not always be possible for headteachers to choose every single member of their staff”. One example given is “shared recruitment exercises at a local authority or regional level” where there is “scope to achieve economies of scale”.</p>

<p>Tim Wallace, president of primary school leaders’ body the AHDS, told <em>Tes Scotland</em> that he had received some very good staff through compulsory transfer and that his members were not as concerned about compulsory transfers as they were about councils carrying out central recruitment campaigns, then placing teachers in schools.</p>

<p>Mr Wallace, headteacher of Paradykes Primary in Midlothian, said: “Some authorities – probably for the best reasons – carry out central recruitment campaigns and then allocate people to schools from that without headteachers having any say. Every school is different and, understandably, headteachers want staff who share their vision.”</p>

<p>Jim Thewliss, general secretary of secondary headteachers’ body School Leaders Scotland, recently told <em>Tes Scotland </em>that staff who are surplus in one school should have to take part in competitive interviews for posts in other schools and should only be appointed if they are the best candidate.</p>

<p>“If you are going to ask headteachers to lead learning in their schools, then they have got to have the opportunity to appoint the correct staff,” he said.</p>

367665,New Scottish standardised tests ‘cannot give a valid national picture’,Local authorities reveal contrasting advice they provided about flagship programme,"<p>An investigation has raised doubts over whether flagship standardised assessments will provide the national overview of educational progress promised by the government.</p>

<p>It reveals that councils’ guidance for schools and teachers on the assessments varies markedly around the country, with some insisting they are set at specific times of year while others leave timings entirely up to schools.</p>

<p>One academic said such varied approaches shows that <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/no-enthusiasm-and-unprepared"">Scottish National Standardised Assessments</a> (SNSAs) are “a waste of time”. The government, however, downplayed the importance of SNSAs as a national measure of progress, saying that they are part of a much broader mix of information.</p>

<p><em>Tes Scotland</em> used Freedom of Information legislation to ask Scotland’s 32 local authorities for any advice or guidance about SNSAs that was given in 2017 to schools, teachers and headteachers, as they prepare for the assessments of P1, P4, P7 and S3 pupils.</p>

<p>The replies, from 27 councils, revealed sometimes starkly contrasting approaches.</p>

<p>Moray, for example, will – at least initially – require year groups to take the assessments at the same time of year annually, in order to “gain an accurate picture of the ‘added value’ of progress” in pupils’ reading, writing and numeracy” and to “reduce unnecessary and prolonged workload and bureaucracy”.</p>

<p>Dumfries and Galloway, however, stated that “we are not indicating an assessment window as this goes against the principles of these assessments”. Glasgow, similarly, will “not be prescribing when young people should be assessed”, explaining that timings should be decided by schools and class teachers.</p>

<p>Lindsay Paterson, professor of education policy at the University of Edinburgh, said that the varied local approaches to SNSAs “cannot give a valid <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/government-under-fire-it-scraps-pupil-performance-survey"">national picture</a>” and that, therefore, “the whole exercise is a waste of time”.</p>

<p>Conservative education spokeswoman Liz Smith said the “wide variation” in approaches shows “very clearly that there is no clarity over the meaning of standardised assessment”.</p>

<p>However, EIS teaching union general secretary Larry Flanagan said: “Teachers are best-placed to know which type of assessments best suit the needs of the children in their classrooms and are best-equipped to decide when to use them. It is essential that there is no pressure placed on teachers to use the SNSAs at a certain point in time.”</p>

<p>A government spokesman said: “Standardised assessments are only <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/swinney-new-national-assessments-will-not-lead-league-tables"">one source of information</a> teachers have available to inform their professional judgement, alongside classwork, observation and other assessment options.</p>

<p>“As we have previously stated, standardised assessment results in isolation will only give a snapshot of how a child is doing – which is why we are focusing on CfE (Curriculum for Excellence) data, which will provide a much fuller and more meaningful picture of how Scotland’s education system is performing and where improvements are required.”</p>

368322,Why we need to fight for the school trip,The unexpected moments that bring joy to pupils make school trips so special for the teachers who organise them,"<p>What Lucy Dowson remembers most about the Year 6 trip she led to Calais is the cherries. Arriving in the French port, having crossed from Portsmouth, they had just three hours to explore before the journey back. The children had been given money to spend in one of the markets and, as they roamed the stalls, Dowson – who teaches at a primary in Hampshire – noticed a sizeable group gathered around a fruit stall.</p>

<p>The objects of fascination were baskets of a fruit the children had never seen before: cherries. “What are they, Miss?” asked one of the boys. Dowson explained.</p>

<p>“Are they like sweets?” he asked.</p>

<p>She thought about it and then answered, tentatively, “Yes”.</p>

<p>Later that day, the French crew of the ferry back to England looked on in bemusement as 60 English 11-year-olds sat on the deck, each with a bag of cherries in hand. The children, enamoured with this newly discovered “sweet”, had bought out the stall’s entire supply.</p>

<p>It is unexpected moments like this that make trips so special for the teachers who organise them. Yes, they plan such excursions for curriculum-related reasons or to boost children’s cultural capital but, sometimes, it is the unplanned moments that end up having a lasting impact.</p>

<h2>Rite of passage</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, offering students such benefits or experiences is becoming difficult to engineer. Trips are expensive and schools are increasingly finding it hard to fund them. Then there is the added issue of a packed curriculum, which can make even a morning out of the classroom tricky to timetable, let alone a week-long excursion.</p>

<p>As this guide demonstrates, though, school trips are worth fighting for. Research is clear that, when done well, they give students a boost in terms of their learning, and their cultural and social knowledge. They are also a rite of passage for many, with first steps into autonomy and self-discovery.</p>

<p>Yes, it is difficult to make trips work – and the risk assessments and admin can seem impossible to squeeze into a teacher’s busy workload – but as these pages makes clear, there are ways of making it manageable.</p>

<p>So have a read, let your imagination run wild and plan that trip. Opening children’s eyes to the world beyond their own community isn’t just the cherry on top of education, it is what education should be all about.</p>

368739,"Schools with deprived pupils less likely to improve, Ofsted figures show",Schools with more disadvantaged students are less likely to increase their grade to 'good' or 'outstanding' than those schools with pupils from affluent areas,"<p>Schools with high proportions of deprived pupils are less likely to improve to ""good"" or ""outstanding"" than those with affluent pupils, according to <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/ofsted-0"">Ofsted</a> data published today.</p>

<p>The Ofsted document states: ""Of schools inspected this year that had previously been judged to require improvement, those with high proportions of pupils from deprived areas were less likely to improve than those with pupils from more affluent areas.""</p>

<p>The figures also show that more than half – 55 per cent – of schools that currently have a rating of ""requires improvement"" have high proportions of <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/disadvangtage"">pupils from disadvantaged areas</a>.</p>

<p>Overall, a lower proportion of schools previously judged to require improvement received a higher rating at their <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/inspection"">inspection</a> this year than in any other previous year. This was true both at primary and secondary level.</p>

<p>A higher proportion of schools – 11 per cent – also dropped to ""inadequate"" this year.</p>

<p>The figures, published today, which include <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/maintained-schools-and-academies-inspections-and-outcomes-as-at-31-august-2017/maintained-schools-and-academies-inspections-and-outcomes-as-at-31-august-2017-main-findings"">data for inspections up to 31 August this year</a>, also show a small increase in the proportion of <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/secondary"">secondary schools</a> rated ""good"" or ""outstanding"": from 78 per cent last year to 79 per cent this year.</p>

<p>Grades remain higher for primary schools – 90 per cent ""good"" or ""outstanding"" – than for secondaries.</p>

<p>The proportion of <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/alternative-provision"">pupil-referral units</a> rated ""good"" or ""outstanding"" also improved, from 86 per cent to 88 per cent, as did the proportion of <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/send"">special schools</a>, from 93 per cent to 94 per cent.</p>

<h2>'Hard work'</h2>

<p>But, overall, the proportion of ""good"" or ""outstanding"" schools remained unchanged since last year: 89 per cent of schools reached this level.</p>

<p>Nine per cent of schools were judged to require improvement at their most recent inspection. This represented a small decrease since last year, when the proportion was 10 per cent.</p>

<p>In response to these figures, the <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/dfe"">school standards minister</a> Nick Gibb said: “We want every child to have access to a good school place – one that provides them with the knowledge and skills to succeed in the future.</p>

<p>“Thanks to changes made by <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/government-and-politics"">the government</a> and the hard work of teachers, there are now 1.9 million more pupils in 'good' or 'outstanding' schools than in August 2010.”</p>

369327,Sweden is a land where the teachers roam free,The Swedish school system gives teachers the opportunity to explore new methods in the classroom,"<p>Next year will be my 10th as a secondary teacher in Sweden. Before, I led a somewhat nomadic existence as an English as a second language (ESL) teacher, after graduating in political science from the University of Dundee.</p>

<p>ESL teaching, while rich in experience, had not proven financially lucrative. Freelancing as a language consultant in Stockholm meant periods of feast or famine, with the summer particularly lean. As the years passed and my Swedish improved, I found myself keen to trade the corporate conference room for the classroom.</p>

<p>When I started my teacher training there was – and still is – talk of a profession in crisis. Few view it as an attractive career. Indeed, in 2014 the reality TV show <em>Paradise Hotel</em> received more applications than the country’s teacher-training colleges. Today there is much debate about improving the status of teachers and the quality of training.</p>

<p>Swedish secondary teachers are trained to teach two subjects. My combination is English and civics – a mixture of modern studies and citizenship. Happily, this has enabled me to draw on my ESL experiences and to use my degree.</p>

<p>Teaching business professionals in Stockholm had taught me that Swedes value consensus and flat organisations. This is reflected in education, too: emphasis is placed on the say students should have over their own education, from choosing their school to influencing what is done in the classroom. I work in an international school, which in many ways is not a typical Swedish school.</p>

<h2>Progressive approach</h2>

<p>While we do not have uniforms, students are still required to address teachers by title, as opposed to using first names. Culturally, this made my transition from a traditional Scottish classroom easier.</p>

<p>In grading and assessment, the approach is more progressive. At the end of their studies, Swedish students do not face a prolonged period of exams – no waiting with bated breath on a brown envelope.</p>

<p>The Swedish system frees teachers from teaching to the test. Students work towards the goals of their courses, covering content outlined by the education authority, Skolverket. There is flexibility in how courses are designed and in the assessment used – this is typically decided in dialogue with students.</p>

<p>Grades are based on what the student has demonstrated by the end of the year. This is done by the teacher – there is no external examination authority. Indeed, for most courses there is no final exam or national test. In subjects that do have a test – such as Swedish, English, maths and modern languages – it serves only as further evidence to support a grade, not to replace it.</p>

<p>The system gives me freedom to explore new methods in the classroom – and the students freedom to take a much more active role in their education than I did at the same age.</p>

369429,The class book review: Singing In The Rain,This book and CD set captured the imagination of an enthusiastic Reception class,"<div><strong>Singing in the Rain</strong></div>

<p> </p>

<p>It was an appropriately wet and blustery day when I read this picture book with our Reception class. The children were instantly engaged by the vibrant and colourful cover illustration – and some members of the group recognised the title as being that of a song that they had heard. Everyone was very eager to read on.</p>

<p>The story begins in a rainy street. Adult readers will immediately spot the references to the famous Gene Kelly film sequence. This time, though, it is a little girl who is singing to us as she twirls merrily around a lamppost.</p>

<p>The illustrator captures the dark skies and the movement of falling raindrops perfectly. As we read on, this rainy backdrop is lit up spectacularly with a growing band of smiling children clad in bright raincoats and wellies, all having a marvellous time. There are no adults to be seen – and we all agreed that adults tend to be much less keen on the rain than children. What a wonderfully positive take on having fun in the rain! Perhaps we could all learn something from these intrepid puddle-splashers?</p>

<p>We wondered where the children were headed as they drifted happily away through the clouds, carried by their umbrellas and propelled by the wind. Then there was a murmur of recognition as we all saw that they had landed far, far away in a wonderfully exotic rainforest landscape.</p>

<h2>Making everyone smile</h2>

<p>We had lots of fun spotting the different jungle animals that, like the children in the story, were also having a wonderful time in the rain. There would definitely be plenty of scope for discussing similarities and differences between our own climate, environment and native animals with those of other countries.</p>

<p>Marni and Niamh loved the depiction of the rainforest. Robin enjoyed spotting the toucans in the trees and Raife liked the parrots in particular. For Henry, the highlight was seeing “the bit where the children flyyyyyyy!” Ottilie remarked that she enjoyed seeing everyone “smiling because of the rain”.</p>

<p>The story certainly made everyone smile on this rainy day. Reception were unanimous in recommending this story to other young readers.</p>

<p>This book also contains a CD of the well-known song, sung by Doris Day. So, after reading the story once to my group, we then played the song as we looked again at all the pictures. The children were instantly captivated by the combination of music and illustration.</p>

<p>Tim Hopgood does a magnificent job of blending the two media, reflecting the musical aspect throughout the story as we follow the bright trail of notes that Ottilie picked up on immediately: “There is beautiful music because she is singing.”</p>

<p>The book and CD also offer a rich resource for further activities. We are sure to make good use of it for our “weather” topic.</p>

<p>Finally, we took the opportunity to express our own joy about rainy weather by dancing around the library to Doris Day, pretending to splash in puddles and flying through the clouds with our imaginary umbrellas. What a glorious feeling to end our storytime.</p>

369450,"'With Brexit looming, schools need to provide world-class careers advice'","Having a 'careers leader' who embeds career learning into the curriculum, develops strong links with businesses and above all, offers personal guidance and support for pupils is crucial, writes two careers experts  
","<p>Young people are staying in school longer and emerging with more qualifications than ever before. Yet often when we meet with employers, they tell us that their new recruits don’t have the skills and attitudes that they need.</p>

<p>We’ve also seen lots of talented young people failing to realise their potential because they don’t understand how the system works. This is particularly the case for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. For all of these reasons, we are excited to welcome the government’s new careers strategy, <em><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/careers-strategy-making-the-most-of-everyones-skills-and-talents"">Making the Most of Everyone’s Skills and Talents</a>. </em>This strategy sets out a new way forward for careers work in schools and colleges.</p>

<p>Three years ago, the Gatsby Charitable Foundation conducted a research project to identify what world-class careers guidance looked like. The project brought together international best practice with the expertise of careers specialists here in the UK to establish the eight Gatsby benchmarks for ""good career guidance"". <a href=""http://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-news/government-launches-new-careers-strategy"">The government’s new strategy </a>endorses the Gatsby Benchmarks and provides schools with a clear steer on what they should be aiming for.</p>

<p>The benchmarks highlight the importance of schools planning their careers provision, making use of high-quality information, tailoring provision to the needs of their pupils and embedding career learning into the curriculum. They also emphasise the need to provide access to employers and working people, quality work experience and encounters with all forms of education and training. Finally, they note that young people should have access to <a href=""http://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/pupils-go-parents-teachers-and-friends-careers-advice-not-careers"">personal guidance to support them in making their decisions.</a></p>

<p>We have seen from the successful pilot of the benchmarks in schools in the North East of England that schools find them easy to use and transformative. We have also developed an online tool called Compass, free for all schools to use, which allows them to review their practice against the benchmarks and identify new ways forward. We are happy that the new strategy encourages schools to use the benchmarks and Compass to work towards the best possible practice in career guidance.</p>

<p>The pilot in the North East has also demonstrated the importance of leadership. Gatsby’s international research highlighted the role of the <em>schooldekaan</em> (careers coordinator) in schools in the Netherlands, a named individual who is responsible for leading the school’s careers programme. We’ve found that if schools are going to successfully implement the benchmarks they need someone in a similar role. In England, we’re calling them careers leaders.</p>

<p>The careers leader needs support from the school’s senior management, but they also need the skills, knowledge and authority <a href=""http://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/careers-education-must-be-about-more-work-experience-says-former-ucas"">to coordinate the complex set of activities that career guidance involves</a>. The new strategy also highlights this role and argues that we need ""high-quality leaders at the heart of our approach"".</p>

<p>We’ve been conducting research in schools across the country to explore how they are managing their careers programmes. Without exception, wherever we’ve found good career guidance, we’ve also found a good careers leader.</p>

<p>These careers leaders’ roles vary, but typically include being:</p>

<ol>
	<li>A<strong> good leader </strong>who takes responsibility for conceiving, running and reporting on the school’s careers programme</li>
	<li>A <strong>skilful manager </strong>who is able to both run projects and in some cases line manage more junior staff</li>
	<li>A <strong>careful coordinator</strong> of staff from across the school</li>
	<li>A <strong>skilled networker </strong>who is able to develop a range of links beyond the school with employers and education and training providers.</li>
</ol>

<p>There can be no doubt then that being a careers leader is a demanding job.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the careers leader is a distinct but complementary role to that of the careers adviser. The careers leader takes responsibility for the school’s whole careers programme. They lead, manage, coordinate and build the networks that support careers provision in a school, but do not necessarily deliver all of this careers support themselves. A careers adviser will be seeing students, providing information, advice and guidance, and offering specific expertise on the labour market, educational pathways and career decision making. Our research suggests that it is common for the careers leader to either manage or commission the careers adviser, although in some circumstances it is possible for the two roles to be combined.</p>

<p>Many careers leaders are teachers who have taken on careers leadership as a middle leadership role, although they can also be careers professionals or people from other professional backgrounds. The background of the careers leader is less important than ensuring that they have the time, authority, knowledge, skills – and, critically, the clear backing of senior school leaders – to do the job.</p>

<p>DfE’s new strategy asks Gatsby and The Careers & Enterprise Company to work together to define the careers leader role and to build a blueprint for training careers leaders. We are happy to take this work forward, building on the pilot in the North East and our other research around careers leaders. This research suggests that the role already exists in many schools in England, which gives us confidence that careers leadership is realistic as well as necessary. We are also able to draw on academic work in this area and further pilots and thinking from Teach First and the Career Development Institute. A real consensus is starting to emerge around careers leadership and we look forward to drawing this consensus together and codifying it in a way that schools can easily implement.</p>

<p>With social mobility, a continuing concern and the proximity of <a href=""http://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/deciding-against-major-investment-schools-points-uninspiring-vision"">Brexit </a>highlighting the importance of homegrown skills, the release of the government’s careers strategy could hardly be more timely. By working together with school leaders, employers and careers specialists we can make the most of this opportunity and help improve career guidance in every school.</p>

<p>This is important for the future of the UK economy and, above all, it is vital for realising the potential of every young person.</p>

369669,Ofsted leadership ratings soar under Spielman,Ofsted staff have more confidence in senior managers than they did last year,"<p>Ofsted's leadership approval ratings by staff have risen dramatically since Amanda Spielman took over.</p>

<p>A <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ofsted-civil-service-people-survey"">survey of civil servants</a> working at the watchdog shows that the proportion of staff who believe the leadership team has a “clear vision for the future of Ofsted”, has risen by 13 percentage points to 70 per cent in the past year.</p>

<p>Across the civil service as a whole, just 49 per cent of staff felt the same.</p>

<p>Ms Spielman took over the role of <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/a-new-year-a-new-chief-inspectora-new-take"">chief inspector in January</a>, following Sir Michael Wilshaw who spent five years in the post.</p>

<p>The Ofsted survey, which was answered by 1,529 staff, also that scores had jumped for other aspects of leadership over the past year.</p>

<p>It found that 70 per cent of staff had confidence in the decisions made by senior managers – up by seven percentage points from last year. More than half - 51 per cent - felt change was managed well – up by eight percentage points from last year.</p>

<p>While a minority (45 per cent) felt that when changes were made in Ofsted they were usually for the better – this was a rise of seven percentage points from when the same question was asked last year.</p>

<p>The survey also found that 75 per cent of workers said they were proud to tell people they worked for Ofsted, up by five percentage points from last year.</p>

<p>But there was less satisfaction with pay, which half of people felt “adequately reflected” their performance, compared with 52 per cent last year.</p>

<p>Ms Spielman's appointment was initially questioned by some MPs.</p>

<p>She was education secretary Nicky Morgam's preferred candidate for the chief inspector job.</p>

<p>But her appointment was opposed by the Commons Education Committee, with the then chair Neil Carmichael claiming she  <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/mps-reject-appointment-amanda-spielman-ofsted-chief-inspector-citing""><strong>lacked the “passion and vision” for the role</strong></a>.</p>

<p>However, <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/morgan-snubs-mps-appoint-amanda-spielman-ofsted-chief-inspector""><strong>Ms Morgan snubbed the committee’s decision</strong></a> and <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/exclusive-amanda-spielman-formally-approved-ofsted-chief-inspector"">recommended her approval </a>to former prime minister David Cameron and the rest of the Privy Council.</p>

369891,"FE will struggle without more funding, warns Ofsted's Spielman","Presenting her first Ofsted annual report as chief inspector, Amanda Spielman raises concerns about poor FE performance – but warns it will continue without more investment","<p>Amanda Spielman has warned that the FE sector will continue to struggle without a higher base rate of funding.</p>

<p>Presenting her first annual report as Ofsted chief inspector, Ms Spielman pointed out that the <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-news/ofsted-annual-report-colleges-performance-drops-signs"">proportion of FE colleges rated good or outstanding in their most recent inspection had dropped</a> from 71 per cent at the end of August 2016 to 69 per cent a year on.</p>

<p>The report points out that 18 colleges' performances declined from ""good"" or ""outstanding"", with inspectors finding too few learners were completing and achieving their qualifications and were not being set ""challenging"" targets or provided with sufficiently detailed feedback.</p>

<h2>'Mismatch'</h2>

<p>Ms Spielman told the audience at the launch in Westminster: ""'I don't want this to be the annual lecture for criticising the state of further education"", but said that the sector's performance ""continues to lag behind"". ""Despite some promising recent inspection outcomes, the headline figures show a further 2 percentage point decline in the number of good and outstanding general FE colleges and a rather larger drop of 8 percentage points for sixth-form colleges,"" she added.</p>

<p>""The government has recognised the problems in the sector and has begun a series of welcome initiatives investing in skills education. However, I do believe that until base rate funding is increased, the sector will continue to struggle.""</p>

<p>After the speech, Ofsted's deputy director for FE and skills, Paul Joyce, told <em>Tes</em> that the inspectorate planned to ""pay particular attention"" to the impact of funding on post-16 provision.</p>

<p>""If we are seeing [situations] where funding is starting to affect the curriculum or the quality of provision, we will start saying [so],"" he said, adding: ""I'm with Amanda, I think there needs to be an increase in funding for this sector to improve.""</p>

<p>Ms Spielman also highlighted the ""mismatch between college provision and the labour market"", arguing that too many colleges put students on ""interesting and engaging"" subjects such as performing arts and sports – with no clear ""line of sight"" to work.</p>

<h2><strong>Spielman 'absolutely right'</strong></h2>

<p>The chief inspector's comments on funding were welcomed by the Sixth Form Colleges Association. Policy officer Deepa Jethwa said: ""The chief inspector was absolutely right to say that institutions will struggle to maintain standards without an increase in the base rate of funding – that was a very helpful intervention and chimes with the main recommendation of the <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-news/colleges-call-cash-address-post-16-funding-crisis"">Support Our Sixth-formers</a> campaign.""</p>

<p>David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, said: “Ofsted’s culture and the taken approach to colleges have both <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-news/spielman-vows-reset-ofsteds-relationship-fe-sector"">changed markedly in the last year under the new chief inspector</a>. We have experienced much more constructive and understanding dialogue and now have a stronger relationship with Ofsted. We are seeing a much more nuanced and thoughtful set of issues emerging in this year’s annual report.</p>

370125,£120m high-tech colleges slow to spark into life,National colleges criticised as expensive ‘localised hubs’ running behind schedule,"<p>Unveiled in 2016, national colleges were described by government as “centres of high-tech training” that would deliver the “workforce of tomorrow” in industries crucial to economic growth.</p>

<p>And it was promised that there would be no shortage of financial support, with government, local enterprise partnerships, FE providers and local authorities pledging to back the five proposed institutions, focused on specialist training at levels 4-6, to the tune of more than £120 million.</p>

<p>But 19 months on, a <em>Tes</em> investigation has revealed that the three colleges that have opened have around 350 students and apprentices between them, with two of the colleges operating out of temporary sites. The National College for the Creative and Cultural Industries (NCCCI) says it has had a “successful first year” with a cohort of 11 students and that it is “pleased” to have 25 students and 86 apprentices on its books this year.</p>

<h2>‘Unproven institutions’</h2>

<p>Of the institutions yet to open, the National College for Nuclear is expected to launch two “hubs” in Cumbria and Somerset in February 2018 – five months behind schedule. And the National College for Onshore Oil and Gas (NCOOG) – intended to train workers for the controversial fracking industry – had also been due to open in September, but its future is in doubt, with no new opening date confirmed.</p>

<p>The University and College Union says it is concerned that millions of pounds have been pumped into a handful of “as-yet-unproven institutions” while existing colleges ”struggle to deal with the impact of budget cuts”. “This approach only fragments our further education system and deprives communities of valuable local learning opportunities,” says general secretary Sally Hunt, who calls on government to “take a more holistic approach”.</p>

<p>Ian Pretty, chief executive of the Collab Group of FE colleges, says too many “are ‘national’ in name only”. “Where a national college is not based on place – such as the national colleges for digital skills and creative industries – they have become little more than localised hubs with very small student enrolments operating in direct competition with existing provision from FE colleges,” he adds.</p>

<p>Ada, the National College for Digital Skills and the NCCCI opened in September 2016. A spokesperson for the former says that it has 110 sixth-form students enrolled – close to the capacity allowed by its current site in North London. This is expected to rise to 150 for 2018-19. It also has 63 apprentices working with “blue-chip employers”, such as Google, Deloitte and EY, set to reach 180 next year.</p>

<p>“We are on track with our business plan...to educate 7,500 students in advanced digital skills by 2023,” the spokesperson adds.</p>

<p>NCCCI’s enrolment target for 2018-19 is 208 students across 12 courses. Principal Jane Button says the college was “designed to fill the current skills gap and ensure the future success of the creative industries”.</p>

<p>The National College for High-Speed Rail, with sites in Birmingham and Doncaster, was opened in October. The college tells Tes it currently has “more than 60 learners”, with 140 expected to be offered places across the next two intakes in January and May. It has received more than 400 applications to date.</p>

<p>Chief executive Clair Mowbray says: “We are generating interest and excitement from people who want to begin a highly rewarding career in high-speed rail.”</p>

<p>Ken Cronin, chief executive of UK Onshore Operations Group, representing the onshore oil and gas industry, says: “It has always been our intention to cement the foundations of NCOOG ahead of offering training.”</p>

<p>A Department for Education spokesperson says: “National colleges are brand-new institutions which are currently in the early stages of development. As they develop, learner numbers are expected to significantly increase.”</p>
","<p>Unveiled in 2016, national colleges were described by government as “centres of high-tech training” that would deliver the “workforce of tomorrow” in industries crucial to economic growth.</p>

370908,Marsden: Office for Students' board is a 'missed opportunity’ for FE,"Board of new regulatory body doesn't represent the diversity of provision – including colleges, says shadow skills minister Gordon Marsden","<p>Shadow skills minister Gordon Marsden has hit out at the government’s decision not to appoint a representative of the FE sector to the board of the new <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/office-for-students-regulatory-framework-for-higher-education"">Office for Students (OfS)</a>.</p>

<p>The government announced the final six new members of the 15-strong board yesterday – including the controversial director of the New Schools Network, Toby Young, and Simon Levine, managing partner and global co-chief executive officer of law firm DLA Piper.</p>

<p>The OfS, the new regulator designed to champion the interests of students, legally came into force yesterday.</p>

<p>According to the government, it will replace the Higher Education Funding Council for England<a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-news/degree-apprenticeships-be-regulated-hefce-not-ofsted""> (Hefce) as the main regulator</a> of higher education, and it will hold universities to account for the quality of teaching they provide. It will also have a legal duty to promote choice and consider the interests of students, employers and taxpayers.</p>

<p>Education secretary Justine Greening said the OfS will play a vital role in ensuring UK universities retain their world-class reputation. “I welcome the new OfS board members to their important new roles. Their experience and skill will be key in ensuring the OfS achieves its ambitions,” she added.</p>

<h2>'One in 10 studies HE in an FE environment'</h2>

<p>OfS chair Sir Michael Barber said he was “delighted to be welcoming another outstanding set of appointments”. “The new board members' broad mix of skills and experiences complement those already appointed. I am confident that the OfS has a board in place that is well-placed to successfully oversee the creation and guide the operation of a new organisation which will be shaping our brilliant higher education sector in the interests of students, short, medium and long term,"" he added. </p>

<p>But shadow minister Gordon Marsden said with the OfS being a “brand new organisation”, the government now had an opportunity to set the tone of what it wants it to be. “When we went over it in Parliament, we stressed the need for the board to be as broad as the student body in HE – and, as I never stop reminding ministers, one in 10 study HE in an FE environment. So this is a huge missed opportunity to put all this into practice. Justine Greening said the board reflected the diversity of the HE sector, but that cannot be said at all,” he added.</p>

<h3>The final six new board members:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Simon Levine, managing partner and global co-chief executive officer of DLA Piper. </li>
	<li>Toby Young, co-founder of the West London Free School, and director the New Schools Network.</li>
	<li>Elizabeth Fagan, senior vice president and managing director of Boots. </li>
	<li>Katja Hall, partner at Chairman Mentors International</li>
	<li>Monisha Shah, chair of Rose Bruford College of Theatre and Performance</li>
	<li>Ruth Carlson, student at Surrey University</li>

It was later announced that <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/who-damian-hinds"">Damian Hinds</a> would be taking over as education secretary.</p>

<p>Association of Colleges (AoC) chief executive David Hughes said he was sorry to see Ms Greening leave. ""She did a lot of good work to build collaboration with AoC and colleges, she had a strong and personal commitment to social mobility and she was one of a few in government with direct experience of learning in a college,” he said.</p>

<p>“Her legacy will include a commitment within the Department for Education to greater investment in technical and professional education and stronger support for colleges to help them deliver great learning opportunities across the country,” added Mr Hughes, who stressed that he was looking forward to building a relationship with her successor, Mr Hinds.</p>

<p>""We know from his time at the Department for Work and Pensions that he is someone we can work with and who will share our strong commitment to social justice. He faces many challenges across schools and universities policy, as well as many opportunities which colleges offer to his department in delivering the education and skills our country needs.” </p>

<p>Mr Hinds is a former grammar school pupil who is also a former member of the Commons Education Select Committee. In 2012 he chaired an all-party parliamentary group which published a report on social mobility. <em><a href=""https://www.raeng.org.uk/publications/other/7-key-truths-about-social-mobility"">Seven Key Truths about Social Mobility</a></em> argued that the point of greatest leverage for social mobility was what happened between the ages of 0 and 3, mainly at home, but “you can also break the cycle through education”.</p>

<h2>Apprenticehips 'must be a priority'</h2>

<p>It said that the most important controllable factor was the quality of teaching, and described the policy challenge as “focus first on quality of teachers and teaching”.</p>

<p>Mark Dawe, chief executive of the Association of Employment and Learning Providers, said he was pleased the new education secretary seemed committed to social mobility.</p>

<p>“Apprenticeships should be a key element of this, but there is a danger at the moment the implementation of this excellent policy will lead to a backwards step,” said Mr Dawe, adding that this was “easily retrieved but requires action now”.  “The secretary of state arrives in the light of some encouraging news on UK productivity levels but to make any increase sustainable, the government must continue to invest in skills training and technical education.”</p>

<p>Following <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/justine-greening-had-one-shortest-tenures-education-secretary"">her resignation</a>, Ms Greening said social mobility mattered more to her than her ministerial career. “I'll continue to do everything I can to create a country that has equality of opportunity for young people and I’ll keep working hard as MP for Putney,” she said.</p>

My school, in a remote town at the end of long road to…nowhere else but the town, doesn’t make a sensible choice for investing in transport facilities. It is a sensible idea to have public transport from that small town go into a larger centre, from where there should be other spokes out to other destinations.</p>

<p>The model doesn’t work the same for the new breed of hubs that are meant to serve schools. For a start, the spokes don’t really exist. Rather than being a system of well-oiled cogs, it feels rather more like a pinball machine, where it’s much more a matter of luck which hub you might bump into.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, hubs are clearly the way forward. Last week, the Department for Education announced £26 million of funding to provide 35 English hubs, to mirror their maths equivalents. There’s presumably no presumption that the two will be in the same places, but I daresay there will be some overlap. It’s hard to know how best these might be organised.</p>

<p>Thirty-five is not that many. There are about 150 local authorities in England and it doesn’t seem that long ago that the majority of these had professional hubs that offered support for several subjects. In many counties there would be more than one hub, in an attempt to make them accessible to a wider proportion of schools. They’d often be underpinned by subject experts who were employed by the local authority offering support to schools in their areas of expertise, sharing good practice.</p>

<p>That’s not the model now. Instead of these locally accessible groups of experts, centrally funded and available to support schools, we now have the offer of 35 remote establishments who will be given the role of trying to spread practice across a huge area.</p>

<p>My school is about a 20-minute drive from the nearest town – where there used to be a teachers’ professional centre. The county’s maths hub is now more than an hour away – and this is not a remote part of the world.</p>

<p>There’s no doubt that many of the maths hubs are doing great work. Some extend their reach far beyond the theoretical community they serve and are having a positive impact on schools. I’m sure the same will be true of the new English hubs. But while £26 million sounds like a lot of money, when you think of it as £3 per pupil, it’s clear that English hubs won’t fix the system overnight.</p>

<p>It’s not to say that hubs won’t be a useful addition to the education landscape. There’s no harm in having schools who are reaching out and supporting others.</p>

<p>There’s plenty to be gained from sharing good practice as widely as possible. However, there’s also a risk. If you have to be an “outstanding” school with excellent results, do we end up directing more resources at establishments who are already the most successful?</p>

<p>What might £26 million of targeted spending achieve if it were invested in supporting and resourcing those schools who face the most difficult challenges? Or better still, what might we be able to achieve with fairer funding for every school?</p>

371907,"'Why it's time to stop worrying about the speed of the learning ""journey""'","The fixation with speed threatens to undermine any focus on teaching for retention or intellectual development and reflective learning, writes one educationist","<p>Jamie Thom, in last week’s <i>Tes</i>, drew attention to the <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/lower-revs-or-face-burnout"">professional and pedagogical benefits </a>that would surely follow if we allowed ourselves to simply slow down. The agents of acceleration include growing workload and expectations (not least around marking and reporting), the fecundity of curriculum content, and the temptation to judge lessons in terms of almost-instantaneous outcomes (as in pupils being seen to have made ""rapid progress"" within the confines of a single lesson).</p>

<p>Pedagogically, the fixation with speed threatens to undermine any focus on teaching for retention, on intellectual development over the longer term, and on asking questions that invite – and allow time for – reflection.</p>

<p>Thom’s plea fits well with voices raised in support of the ""<a href=""http://www.slowmovement.com/slow_schools.php"">Slow Education"" initiative</a>, which itself grew out of exasperation about proliferating course content and standardised testing, and which seeks to disassociate schools from the broader psychological and societal consequences of what Robert Colvile called <a href=""https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/the-great-acceleration-9781408840061/""><em>The Great Acceleration</em></a>.</p>

<p>This movement contends that <em>process</em> is central to the learning experience, or, to put it another way, <em>how</em> we teach is as important as <em>what</em> we teach. Learning is likened to a journey, and the richness and depth of the experience might be compromised if we always opt for the shortcut.</p>

<p>Taking things more slowly is not something that comes easily given the assumption of a causal relationship between pace and engagement. Fears abound that a slower pace invites boredom and distraction. But slower strategies might, paradoxically, entail short-cuts if all we are doing is padding – lengthening discussion time, spending more time in teacher talk mode, spinning out student activities. For all these reasons, there is no simple relationship between pace and engagement, let alone learning.</p>

<p>Still, the analogy at the heart of the slow education movement is worthy of critique. Is <em>speed</em> (whether fast or slow) what we should really be focusing on? Someone observing a lesson and looking for rapid progress might assume that all that matters is the distance (intellectual activity?) covered by an object (pupil?) in unit time (length of lesson?). Maybe instead, we should focus not so much on the distance covered in the time available, but on the overall direction of travel.</p>

<p>Physicists define <em>velocity</em> as the rate at which an object <em>changes its position</em>. I understand this to mean that if a car moving at breakneck speed takes a circular route back to its starting position, its average velocity would turn out to be zero.</p>

<p>A lesson characterised by frenetic energy involves movement, but not necessarily direction; it might have speed but not velocity. But neither would continually stepping forward and then back, however slowly and deliberately, take us to a different place.</p>

<p>In defining the ideal learning ""journey"" we should worry less about speed, or even total ""distance"" travelled. Rather, we should consider the idea of <em>displacement</em> – exactly how far the objects (those pesky pupils again) have traveled (intellectually) from their starting point in unit time. Effective learning, like velocity but unlike speed, has a directional component.</p>

372213,How to get kids moving in literacy and numeracy,Schools are being encouraged to make literacy and numeracy lessons more physically active as part of a new initiative led by BBC Education and the Premier League.,"<p>The Premier League and BBC Education have launched a new initiative to get classrooms to be more active places. We sat down with Sinéad Rocks, director of education at the BBC, to ask what, exactly, they want teachers to do. </p>

<h3><strong>So, you think kids aren’t active enough?</strong></h3>

<p>Yes, recent research suggests there is a global shift towards physical inactivity. In just 44 years the UK became 20 per cent less <a href=""http://e13c7a4144957cea5013-f2f5ab26d5e83af3ea377013dd602911.r77.cf5.rackcdn.com/resources/pdf/en/full-report.pdf"">physically active</a> and this is trending toward a 35 per cent decline by 2030. That has serious implications for the UK’s children.</p>

<h3><strong>What type of implications?</strong></h3>

<p>Research also shows that active children’s brains actually work better. Physical activity improves cognition, concentration, attention, memory, planning and a host of abilities that are fundamental to educational success. Also, children who are less active are more at risk of becoming overweight or obese.</p>

<h3><strong>And you want schools to help?</strong></h3>

<p>We want schools to be part of the solution. The BBC and the Premier League are working in partnership on a new initiative called Super Movers. It helps primary school teachers to inspire children to become more active throughout their school day.</p>

<h3><strong>Do you mean like PE?</strong></h3>

<p>Actually, no. Super Movers is about integrating more physical activity into lessons. It’s about active learning. We have produced a series of videos to give children a workout while they learn about something in literacy or numeracy. You can watch the introductory video <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2018/super-movers-launch"">here</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>The curriculum is tightly packed already and workload pressures are acute. This sounds like more work for teachers...</strong></h3>

<p>It shouldn't be. It’s designed to be an easy way to integrate more movement into lessons. There are lots of free, curriculum-linked resources to use.</p>

<h3><strong>But is this just another thing teachers are going to have to be trained for, maybe even physically fit for? </strong></h3>

<p>Super Movers films are simple to use, most are linked to key literacy and numeracy concepts, but there are also some that are just for fun. You definitely don’t need to be able to do 10 laps of the school playing field to get match fit.</p>

<h3><strong>Any research to back this up? </strong></h3>

<p>Yes. Lots of research shows that doing short bouts of exercise helps children to <a href=""http://http://bit.ly/2A8VSYk"">focus on school work</a>.  And, according to US ergonomist Mark Benden, physical activity can also improve behaviour and <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/tes-talks-tomark-benden"">make classes easier to manage</a>.   </p>

<h3><strong>So if teachers are interested, what should they do?</strong></h3>

<p>Taking part in the <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/5cVlGTF16Xdzr0NBHR4Snfq/super-movers-live-lesson"">Super Movers Live Lesson</a> on Thursday 18th January – a fun active maths session for 7-9 year olds – would make a great start.</p>

<p>You should also try to incorporate some physical activity into your lessons every day, even if it’s not your turn for PE in the hall.</p>

<p>Here are four resources you can use to make literacy and numeracy more active:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href=""https://www.tes.com/teaching-resource/kung-fu-punctuation-6339647"">Kung Fu punctuation</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Lead pupils through practising correct use of punctuation by attributing a ""kung fu"" move to each piece of punctuation and performing these, complete with sound effects.</p>

</ul>

<p>Get your students rushing around the classroom, seeking out hidden problems to solve.</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href=""https://plprimarystars.com/resources/active-learning-maths"">Active adding and subtracting</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>Spread out pairs of numbered floor markers around the classroom. Get pupils to move around them to add or subtract the two figures. When pupils know the answer, get them to jump on the spot for the correct number of times.</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href=""https://plprimarystars.com/resources/active-learning-english"">Active adjectives</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Set out letter floor markers around the room and get pupils to move around to music. When the music stops, you read a sentence such as “The stadium is…” and pupils have to finish the sentence using adjective starting with the letter that is nearest to them.</p>

373035,Tes talks to…Teresa Cremin,"The Open University professor and trustee of the UK Literacy Association tells Kate Townshend that if teachers really want their pupils to be keen readers and writers, they need to show them that they are keen readers and writers themselves","<p>Teresa Cremin has some questions for you: when was the last time you read a book? When was the last time you did some non-work-related writing? And when was the last time that you asked your students to do either of those things?</p>

<p>The answer to that last question will likely come more readily to mind than the answers to the first two. And Cremin, who is a professor of education at The Open University, thinks that is a problem.</p>

<p>“It’s critical to think about authenticity,” she explains. “It’s not about being a role model for the sake of it, but offering young people an authentic example of an adult reader and writer in their daily lives. It’s about teachers taking the risk to write in front of children or bringing in their pile of reading from the weekend.”</p>

<p>Cremin believes this is not just about motivational impact, but also making you a better teacher.</p>

<p>“If we reflect on ourselves as readers and writers, what we choose to read and how we engage, we’ll see that our practice is really diverse,” she argues. “You start thinking about what counts as literacy and being literate in the classroom. It’s not a case of ‘do as I do’, of course … but recognising this diversity and then thinking about some of the consequences. ‘Is my definition of literacy within my classroom wide enough? Or is it too defined by government definitions?’”</p>

<p>Cremin’s thinking is informed not just by her academic role, but also by her other duties: a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts and a trustee of the UK Literacy Association. She also has a background in psychology and is a former primary school teacher.</p>

<p>So let’s take the concept of teachers as readers first. What exactly does she mean by that? Cremin believes that the self-questioning process prompted by reading for pleasure as a teacher can lead to a better understanding of how to get students reading for pleasure, too. This, she argues, is crucial not just to create life-long readers, but also for broad academic success.</p>

<p>“International evidence suggests reading for pleasure offers massive cognitive and emotional benefits, as well as better attainment in maths and literacy,” she explains. “In fact, if you read independently outside school, it makes a difference to your life chances. And when you think about it, this makes sense: if you read for fun you’re going to have a wider vocabulary and better general knowledge, but you’ll also be able to think empathetically and be mindful about where other people are coming from. These are critical 21st-century skills.”</p>

<p>Reading for pleasure assists you in helping children to develop these skills because it gives you insights you otherwise would not have, she says.</p>

<p>“[For example,] having been reflective, you might think about where you like to read and how you’re most comfortable,” Cremin suggests. “For me, that might be curled up on my bed or my sofa. I recognise my rights to read what and where I want, and to talk to my partner about what I’m reading. All of those practices build autonomy and community, and we need to foster these same ideas in the classroom.”</p>

<p>Reading for pleasure also reminds you that reading is a social experience, she adds. “Reading is individual, but it’s hugely social, too. Children need to talk about what they’re choosing to read, not just what they have to study. And for them to be able to do that you need to create a community of readers in your classroom. They need to be able to see their teacher sharing books, but also being moved by them or laughing at them, or they need to hear her ask, ‘Who wants to read this after me?’</p>

<h2>‘Book blether’ and reading for pleasure</h2>

<p>“You need the collective in your classroom, including the teacher and the teaching assistant, too. That way, we’re not checking on each other; we are genuinely, having read a book, wanting and needing to talk about it. I call it ‘book blether’ – that human need to talk about what we’ve read, and life in general. This is where peer recommendations of books can come in handy, too.”</p>

<p>Peer recommendations for reading for pleasure should, she states, come from the teacher, as well as other students. And she says that this can be where some teachers struggle.</p>

<p>“Teachers have a professional responsibility to have a rich, wide knowledge of literature, yet there is evidence that some teachers rely largely on the books they knew and loved in their own childhoods,” she explains. “And while Roald Dahl is great, there are so many other writers that children won’t be introduced to unless their teachers know them. We need CPD that allows teachers to widen their knowledge of texts and helps them share their understanding and passion for those texts with their classrooms.”</p>

<p>That’s not to say she wants teachers to create generic whole-school reading lists.</p>

<p>“Increasingly, we offer lists to parents – and while there can be a benefit here in knowing the names of a wider range of authors, there’s also a danger that it becomes a kind of canon of literature, rather than children choosing what and who they want to read,” Cremin explains. “Besides, lists like this very quickly become out of date and if you start when your child begins primary school, five years later there’s literally nothing contemporary on that list.</p>

<p>“Rather than an endless list of pre-set recommendations, a ‘reading teacher’ (a teacher who reads and a reader who teaches) will be able to offer two or three suggestions targeted at an individual child.”</p>

<p><img height=""844"" width=""1500"" class=""media-element file-default img-responsive"" typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""http://tes.com/sites/default/files/tes260118_42_inline_0.jpg"" alt="""" /></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Reading for pleasure, though, is just one half of the equation Cremin set out at the beginning of this article: arguably harder for teachers to tackle, she believes, is becoming a more regular writer. But she points to a project called Teachers as Writers – which she undertook in partnership with Arvon, the creative-writing organisation, and the University of Exeter and which involved 16 teachers spending a week working with professional writers and writing themselves – to explain how important it can be.</p>

<p>“They wrote, they shared, they engaged in workshops – and, as a result, they learned an enormous amount about the nature of the writing process that you just won’t know unless you’re regularly writing alongside your pupils,” she explains.</p>

<p>“For instance, in that week it was very clear that teachers went for a walk to find the next part of narrative, or thought about it overnight. The opportunities they took to incubate ideas and explore possibilities were very different from how we often offer writing at school, where it’s much more likely to be a linear process of plan, draft, write, edit, then it’s marked. And we need to be aware that this is very different from the world of real writers.”</p>

<p>She adds that another issue that becomes clear when teachers write themselves is that sharing writing can be difficult.</p>

<p>“Many teachers lacked confidence when sharing their writing, or were very critical of their own work. And we need to recognise that children may similarly lack confidence when writing,” she says. “It’s one thing to give your class instructions, but when you sit down to do it, you think, ‘Wow, this is hard!’ Are you giving your children enough opening time, discussing time, time to generate ideas?”</p>

<p>Being willing to take the leap and share your own writing with students can be transformational, Cremin argues.</p>

<p>“If you’re authentic, you might be modelling or writing alongside the children, and then sharing what you’ve done – you can talk about what you were trying to do, what you as the author were intending – and this takes the discussion back to what writing is really about,” she explains. “You might also have a blank spot if you’re modelling authentically (no planning your ‘modelled write’ the night before!), but this can also help the children to understand that getting stuck on a spelling, for instance, is human and normal. It shows them that you can still be a writer and get stuck on a word, rather than, ‘I’m rubbish at writing because I’m not good at spelling.’”</p>

<p>Obviously being both a reader and being a writer alongside being a teacher is not easy – teachers are extremely overworked already, so reading for pleasure or writing a piece of prose will be tough. But Cremin’s suggestions include in-lesson modelling, too, and she argues that what is required is simply a different mindset: “We need less focus on reading and writing and more on what it means to be a reader and a writer.”</p>

","<p>Children questioning their gender are ""unhelpfully"" offered support to implement permanently what are ""generally passing phases of growing up"", a peer has said.</p>

<p>Lord Singh of Wimbledon said that, as a Sikh, he is appalled by the emphasis on <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/sex-and-relationships-education"">sexual relationships and sexual identity</a> at school.</p>

373449,Skills minister says she will put on tin hat and battledress to fight for FE,Anne Milton has said she would fight for the FE sector amid calls from both sides of the House of Commons to increase funding,"<p>Skills minister Anne Milton told the Commons she had her ""tin hat"" and her ""battle dress"" on to fight for FE.</p>

<p>Speaking at education questions on Monday, the <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-news/anne-milton-set-stay-apprenticeships-and-skills-minister"">Department for Education minister</a> said: ""I will always battle on behalf of the sector, independent training providers, those 50 per cent of young people who don't go to university.""</p>

<p>This followed comments by Labour's Nic Dakin, a former shadow education minister, who said that students got 21 per cent less for their education from 16 to 19, compared with 11 to 16, adding that the government’s planned <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-views/post-16-skills-plan-may-fall-short-a-coherent-vision-education"">tertiary review </a>needed to start with the 16-19 provision.</p>

<h2><strong>Need for 'proper' FE funding</strong></h2>

<p>Shadow FE minister Gordon Marsden also called on Milton to ""get a grip"" on the apprenticeship levy.</p>

<p>Ms Milton said she rejected the suggestion, saying the government ""has really got to grips with this"".</p>

<p>Conservative MP Peter Aldous said colleges such as <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/new-wave-principals-looking-shake-fe"">East Coast College</a>, which has campuses in Great Yarmouth and his constituency in Lowestoft, were doing great work – but needed to be properly funded.</p>

373548,Funding campaign heads 'invoice' Treasury for £3.5 billion,Thousands of headteachers have sent a joint letter to the government demanding billions of extra funding,"<p>Headteachers from 31 counties across England have sent the government an invoice for £3.5 billion – the amount they believe they would receive under a fairer funding system.</p>

<p>Accompanying the invoice is a letter to chancellor Phillip Hammond warning that the schools have ""reached a point of no return"" because of the pressures being placed on their budgets.</p>

<p>The letter, from the Worth Less? campaign group representing 5,500 schools, say these pressures have forced them to rely on parents for financial contributions and prop up budgets with pupil premium money aimed at disadvantaged children. </p>

<h2>School funding difference</h2>

<p>The £3.5 billion represents the difference between the amount of money pupils attract on average across the campaign's schools, compared with those in Westminster.</p>

<p>The national funding formula being introduced this year will simply ""lock in previous historical funding injustices"", the letter states.</p>

<p>It says: ""Our schools need to be given the same 'tools' to deliver as other better-funded parts of the country.  Our children all sit the same examinations and our schools are judged by the same Ofsted criteria. </p>

<p>The letter comes the day after <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/damian-hinds-schools-have-more-money-ever-history-country"">education secretary Damian Hinds </a>told MPs: ""There is more money going into our schools in this country than ever before in the history of the country.""</p>

<p>But, while real-terms spending on schools has risen over the past two decades, <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/ifs-greenings-funding-pledge-amounts-real-terms-cut-over-four-years"">it fell by 4 per cent between 2015 and 2017 – and is being frozen for two years until 2019.</a></p>

<h2>'Thoroughly misleading'</h2>

<p>The Department for Education's permanent secretary <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/more-schools-going-deficit-top-dfe-official-tells-mps"">Jonathan Slater yesterday admitted </a>that the number of maintained schools going into deficit has increased during the past year, with academies set to see a similar trend.</p>

<p>In response to the letter, a DfE spokesperson said: “The campaign’s calculations are thoroughly misleading and ignore the fact that under our national funding formula, funding is based on the needs and characteristics of each individual school.</p>

<p>“We are investing an additional £1.3 billion in school funding over and above existing plans, with core schools funding rising from almost £41 billion in 2017-18 to £43.5 billion in 2019-20.</p>

<p>“There are no cuts in funding. Every school will see an increase in funding through the formula from this year. In 2019-20, all secondary schools will attract at least £4,800 per pupil and all primary schools will attract at least £3,500 per pupil.”</p>

373656,Meet the winners of the senior leadership team of the year: Wolverhampton Grammar School ,Wolverhampton Grammar School have won the senior leadership team of the year award at this year's Tes Independent School Awards ,"<p>Few things play a bigger part in a school’s success than its staff, and Wolverhampton Grammar School’s wide range of initiatives to improve staff development and opportunities were truly impressive.</p>

<p>The projects included a fund to support postgraduate training, research grants for teachers and a review of staff engagement in all strategic planning, as well as new CPD opportunities to help early career development, and media and external relations training.</p>

<p>Comments in the staff survey showed how this has paid off: “When you have a young family and spend most of your time at work, it’s important to enjoy coming into work, find your role rewarding and see you can make a difference”; “this is the best school I have ever worked in”; and “the environment we work in is first rate and I believe the senior team will take the school to even greater heights”. </p>

<p>This was just one area where Wolverhampton showed judges it could meet the criteria of “demonstrating excellence in strategy and direction”. Low student fees, an excellent ISI inspection report, the depth of community outreach and the achievement of pupils all confirmed this senior leadership team as a worthy winner.</p>

<p>The judges said: “This was a category with a number of really creative strategic initiatives from a wide variety of schools in different contexts. The judges chose Wolverhampton Grammar School because it was clear that a closely knit team was addressing with real care many aspects of school life which directly impacted on the experience of teachers.</p>

<p>“The personal, and apparently voluntary, testimonials from staff about their love of working in the school were also significant in the judges’ choice.”</p>

373794,How to fix the levy is a taxing question,The apprenticeship levy isn’t working under the UK’s devolved governments. What’s the solution? Let’s call it a tax and give the wider training system the funding boost it badly needs,"<p>Living in Scotland, few issues are as constant a part of the public debate as devolution. Is anything short of full independence any use at all? Can a system where one administration has power over one policy, but isn’t able to influence other policies connected to or affected by that, be more than a token gesture?</p>

<p>The apprenticeship levy is an excellent example of the challenges such a system creates. Introduced by Westminster, it is now paid by large employers across the UK. The idea, of course, is that in return for paying the levy, these businesses get access to a digital account, allowing them to invest in apprenticeships and helping the government to achieve its aim of 3 million apprenticeship starts by 2020. However, that isn’t actually how it works. Or rather, that isn’t how it works outside England. This week, we highlight how the levy works for businesses in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and how they see little benefit.</p>

<h2>Evolution since devolution</h2>

<p>It is impossible to miss the political sensitivities here. UK policies run the risk of being seen as something “imposed” by Westminster, without consultation. Even if the way the English digital accounts system operates had suited Scotland, what were the chances that the Scottish authorities would have simply acknowledged this as a good idea and rolled it out in the same way?</p>

<p>The flipside is that the education and skills systems have evolved since devolution and, as a result, new initiatives from London are unlikely to be a fit for all four systems. And it’s not as if it’s even working well in England: apprenticeship take-up is down and companies aren’t spending what’s available to them. So what now?</p>

<p>Maybe the easiest solution would be to cut out the window-dressing: let’s call the levy a tax. This is how it is viewed by many employers, and such a change would remove the idea that employers deserve a direct benefit in return, while the wider training system would receive a boost in funding that it desperately needs.</p>

<p>It would also give all four nations the freedom to continue to develop their systems as they see fit.</p>

374058,Next steps: what comes after headship?,"The skills you acquire as a headteacher are useful and desirable, so when the time comes to move on, the direction you take is up to you","<p>It was after much agonising and many sleepless nights that I contacted my chair of governors to tell him that we should start the process of appointing my successor as headteacher of our school.</p>

<p>I had been in the profession for nearly 40 years, but I knew that it was time to go. This was in the summer of 2016. At the tender age of 59, I officially “retired”.</p>

<p>When I say retired, I mean that I took my pension. But after 26 years as a headteacher, I wasn’t going to be content with a warm fire and a cup of cocoa. I knew I wanted to do something else. The question was: what?</p>

<p>Too often, headteachers and teachers think they can teach but that they don’t know how to do anything else. I’d done a bit of writing, I had supported many schools and I had experience of talking to students. But was that enough?</p>

<p>I have never been one for attending courses, but in the 18 months leading up to my departure, I went to a “setting up a business” seminar. This helped me to recognise that I had a skillset that was useful and desirable. By the time I actually left my post, my intention was to try to set up a business.</p>

<p>I wrote a business plan. Then I enlisted the services of an accountant, who guided me through the paperwork.</p>

<p>It was much easier and cheaper to set up a business than I thought. Even opening a bank account was relatively easy. In no time at all, I had become a director of my own company.</p>

<h3>Securing work</h3>

<p>Next came the task of securing work. I had my first interview in more than 20 years – for a post with my local authority, touring universities to encourage teachers to work in our county. Suddenly, I had my first 40 days’ work for the year. Other jobs seemed to fall in my lap. In fact, in that first term, I could easily have worked full-time hours.</p>

<p>Herein lies a real issue for life after headship: how much did I want to do? What stress level was I creating for myself? For the first time, I could determine my own work-life balance. There are many opportunities waiting for you after headship. I did a lot of writing, spent time in schools supporting new teachers and setting up new teams. I was also able to sit on committees I had previously turned down because of work commitments, and did voluntary work, too.</p>

<p>The key is not to do too much. I now take on what I want to. I have a life that, for the first time in years, I can actually control. I’ve no idea what the next year will bring but, for an old man like me, that is exciting in itself.</p>

374142,Scrap 'resource swallowing' GCSE resits in favour of functional skills,"Former skills minister Robert Halfon says literacy and numeracy are the 'bedrock of academic and vocational success', but too many students fail GCSE resits","<p>Students who fail their maths and English GCSEs should be offered functional skills courses instead of compulsory resits, the <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/former-dfe-minister-robert-halfon-chair-education-select-committee"">chair of the Education Select Committee</a> is expected to say in a speech on Monday.</p>

<p>At a panel event organised by the Centre for Social Justice, the Learning and Work Institute and the Open University in London, Robert Halfon will say <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-views/we-must-acknowledge-importance-private-gcse-and-a-level"">literacy and numeracy are the bedrock of academic and vocational success</a>, adding: “But rather than swallow valuable resources by insisting on retakes for those who fail English and Maths, with failure rates of over two thirds in each case, we should be offering these individuals functional skills courses to improve their basic literacy and numeracy.”</p>

<h2><strong>'Crown jewel'</strong></h2>

<p>It comes after the former skills minister asked for the Education Select Committee to see evidence that English and maths resits were damaging students mental health based on <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-news/maths-and-english-gcse-resits-leading-mental-health-challenges"">comments from the chair of the Association of College's (AoC) Mental Health Policy Group Stuart Rimmer</a> who spoke to an inquiry into young people's mental health provision on Tuesday.</p>

<p>In a wide-ranging speech, Halfon will stress that if the government is going to continue to ""lavishly fund"" universities then they much specialise in areas where there are skills gaps.</p>

<p>He will also say FE colleges should be better supported and incentivised to deliver intermediate and higher technical courses adding that he believes degree apprenticeships could be the ""crown jewel in a revamped technical offering"".</p>

<h2><strong>A call to arms</strong></h2>

<p>The panel will consider the need for a ""skills revolution"" in further and higher education in order to achieve social justice.</p>

<p>The chief executive of the Learning and Work Institute Stephen Evans, who is on the panel, said it was time for a call to arms to tackle the UK’s skills challenge. He added: “Nine million adults have low literacy or numeracy, and one million fewer adults are improving their skills each year than in 2010. Growth in apprenticeships is welcome, but we need everyone to be able to access one.”</p>

<p>Head of education policy for the Centre for Social Justice and fellow panelist James Scales said technical education was a pale shadow of its academic cousin, adding: “It is vital that we unlock technical education's enormous potential. Supercharged by technological innovation, the world economy is redefining the contours of economic success and we must find a secure place in this new terrain.”</p>

374379,Investigation: Closure fears for London Challenge spin-off plagued by infighting and mismanagement,Formal investigations by the Government Internal Audit Agency and accountancy firm Landau Baker into the London Leadership Strategy raised concerns over the state of its finances,"<p>One of Britain’s best-known school improvement networks, the <a href=""http://londonleadershipstrategy.com/"">London Leadership Strategy</a> (LLS), could collapse amid concerns raised by formal investigations into allegations of financial mismanagement of a £2 million government grant, Tes can reveal.</p>

<p>The past year has seen the organisation plagued by bitter infighting among staff and directors at LLS, prompted by claims involving its former managing director, <a href=""https://twitter.com/anitakntweets"">Anita Kerwin-Nye</a>, who stepped down last November.</p>

<p>LLS, a not for profit company largely funded by government grants, arose out of the London Challenge school improvement scheme which was credited with helping to transform the fortunes of the capital’s schools under the last Labour government.</p>

<p>It was awarded a £2,042,857 contract in May 2016, which ends next month, by the Department for Education to develop a SEND Review guide tool to help schools support pupils and promote best practice.</p>

<h2>Conflict</h2>

<p>However, multiple sources – ranging from current and former LLS directors and staff, as well as leading education figures – have expressed concern over the way in which LLS has been run.</p>

<p>Individuals have been reluctant to speak out openly due to a fear of harming the reputation of the network and casting a shadow over its track record.</p>

<p>But former directors have described the situation at LLS as “like a Greek tragedy” with the organisation in “a mess” and a “lot of acrimony between people”.</p>

<hr />
<p><a href=""http://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/investigation-auditors-found-financial-management-lls-disarray"">Investigation: Auditors found the financial management at LLS in disarray</a></p>

<p><a href=""http://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/investigation-questions-answer"">Investigation: Questions to answer</a></p>

<hr />
<h2>Fears for the future</h2>

<p>They claim that people are frightened of speaking out publicly. One source close to the organisation, echoing concerns expressed by others, told Tes: “The word is that they [LLS] are going to close down, that’s what people are saying.”</p>

<p>The £2m DfE contract that provides much of its funding comes to an end in March this year. LLS has decided not to apply for a renewal of the contract, which is due to start in April and is worth between £2.6-3.4m over the next two years. The organisation has just £3,348 in reserves, according to its <a href=""https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/07998693/filing-history"">unaudited accounts</a> for the year ended 31 August 2017, which were released last week.</p>

<p>It has emerged that mounting unrest on the LLS board, fuelled by fears of financial mismanagement, resulted in several board directors leaving in protest last year.</p>

<p>Tes has established – through a number of sources – that at least three resigned due to concerns over Ms Kerwin-Nye’s management of the organisation. Directors Rob Carpenter, Dame Sue John, Vijita Patel, Isabel Ramsay, Sir Craig Tunstall, Peter White, and Karen Willis all stepped down in May 2017.</p>

<h2>Controversy</h2>

<p>One former board director told Tes: “There were lots of issues around transparency, the way meetings were run and the feeling that when we challenged rightly, as directors, we were told ‘don’t question this’.”</p>

<p>Another aspect had been the concerns over finances, particularly about how funding that had been provided was actually spent.</p>

<p>Ms Kerwin-Nye joined the organisation as managing director in 2013 and was paid through the company she co-founded, NotDeadFish.</p>

<p>She had previously spent just over a year as chief executive of the My World Charity. Its accounts for the year ended 31 March 2013 show that no income was recorded and the sole member of full-time staff was on an annual salary of around £71,000. Before that, she spent five years as director of a coalition of charities called The Communication Trust, leaving in 2012.</p>

<p>Her remuneration during her time at LLS soared from around £60,000 a year to a six-figure sum, according to sources close to the organisation. Ms Kerwin-Nye has stated that her day rate was £500 and that she worked 16 days a month on average. This equates to remuneration of almost £100,000 a year for working less than five days a week.</p>

<p>Ms Kerwin-Nye has stated that she was supported in the work she did for LLS by a team at her company, NotDeadFish.</p>

<p>Bank account details seen by Tes reveal that her company, NotDeadFish, received more than £118,000 from LLS in just seven months between 25 November 2016 and 28 June 2017. NotDeadFish went into <a href=""https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/08271426/filing-history"">liquidation</a> last November with debts including hundreds of thousands owed in tax and VAT, according to documents at Companies House.</p>

<p>A former director of LLS told Tes how finances “were a constant source of discussion” and claimed: “At the heart of it was the bad value for money that people felt that NotDeadFish and/or Anita were.”</p>

<h2>Blowing the whistle</h2>

<p>Last summer, a former LLS worker wrote to Stuart Miller, deputy director, special educational needs and disability unit, DfE, alleging that hundreds of thousands in government funding had been misappropriated.</p>

<p>At around the same time, a delegation of former LLS board directors met with Ann Gross, director of life skills, disadvantage and SEND, DfE, to echo the concerns.</p>

<p>The department subsequently commissioned the Government Internal Audit Agency to mount an investigation – the results of which have not been published, although LLS and Ms Kerwin-Nye state that the report made no findings of financial impropriety.</p>

<p>In an email sent to the whistleblower last October and seen by Tes, an official from the DfE’s fraud, error and debt team thanked them for having done “the right thing”. They added: “The Department will now be working to address a number of risks.”</p>

<p>The government’s decision to investigate the allegations of financial mismanagement came just months after Professor David Woods, LLS chair, asked LLS directors Jo Dibb and Terry Molloy to mount an internal investigation into alleged financial irregularities made by a whistleblower at the organisation.</p>

<p>Conducted last April, it concluded that “LLS systems are not secure enough to deal with the level of operational fluidity and speed with which decisions need to be made at key times”. It also found “a lack of clarity in terms of financial responsibilities and practices and a lack of rigour in the oversight of finances by the Board”.</p>

<p>The report recommended that the organisation “conduct a contract review with the MD with a view to improving financial procedures, processes and governance”.</p>

<h2>Auditors brought in</h2>

<p>LLS also commissioned an external audit done by accountancy firm Landau Baker, the same company used by LLS director Jacqueline Valin to audit the accounts of Southfields Academy, where she is the principal.</p>

<p>Landau Baker’s report stated: “The effective implementation of the company’s financial procedures and policies need to be improved.”</p>

<p>It said: “There is no indication that any misappropriation of funds has occurred,” and no evidence of “any financial impropriety.”</p>

<p>However, it admitted “there was a lack of documentation available to enable an effective review” of financial systems.</p>

<p>The auditors said they were unable to comment whether board or staff members were authorising payments to themselves, partners or relatives due to not enough paperwork. They suggested that LLS bring in a financially qualified non-executive director and have its accounts externally audited.</p>

<h2>Responses to claims</h2>

<p>A statement by the LLS board said that the allegations “regarding the managing director's conduct of the business” were investigated “through an internal LLS review alongside an externally commissioned financial investigation”.</p>

<p>It added: “Neither review found any evidence of financial impropriety but the independent financial investigation made a number of recommendations where financial management and governance could be improved.”</p>

<p>The board accepted the recommendations and improved financial policies and controls, according to the statement.</p>

<p>It said that when the DfE looked into “similar allegations” regarding the SEND contract, its report made “similar comments to the investigation commissioned by LLS and also cleared the LLS of any financial impropriety”.</p>

<p>Ms Kerwin-Nye said: “These allegations repeat those first raised a year ago by a former LLS contractor, when he was being managed over concerns in his work, and they have been the subject of an LLS investigation – including an external audit, which cleared me.”</p>

<p>She added: “The contractor then took exactly the same concerns to the DfE, who carried out a standard investigation and audit into LLS, which resulted in LLS being cleared and their DfE contract continued.”</p>

<p>In a statement, a DfE spokesperson told Tes: “We have taken swift action in response to concerns that were raised with us, including a robust audit of the contract to ensure we are confident in the service the London Leadership Strategy (LLS) is providing.”</p>

<p>They added: “Our priority remains ensuring children with additional needs to get the support they require and we are continuing to work closely with LLS to achieve this.”</p>

<p>When approached by Tes, Professor Woods said: “This contract is value for money…and there have been very good outcomes.”</p>

<p>But LLS will not be bidding for the next big SEND contract after its current grant ends in March. Professor Woods said: “We don’t think we have the capacity to help manage a big contract going forward.”</p>

<p>Asked whether LLS would be closed down, he remarked: “It’s for the directors to discuss, it certainly won’t be closed down because of allegations from a whistleblower.”</p>

374385,How to support a pupil who makes a disclosure for a friend,"Safeguarding support should extend to the friends of vulnerable pupils, who may be taking on a greater burden than we realise, argues one assistant head","<p>""Miss, can I talk? I am really worried about my friend Becca. She messaged me again loads last night. Her last message at 11pm said something about how she doesn't see the point in life. Then the messages stopped. I couldn't sleep, so I ended up waking up Mum, who phoned Becca’s mum to check Becca was OK. She was, but now she is in a mood with me. I really want to be her friend and help but I am always mucking it up.</p>

<p>""The school nurse told Becca to stop offloading onto me as it’s not fair – that she should speak to the counsellor instead. Everyone says that she is doing it for attention, but I don't think so. I think she just needs help. Can you help her?""</p>

<p>What do you do when a pupil approaches you like this, asking for help for a friend? It is such a tricky issue for <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/safeguarding"">safeguarding professionals</a>, especially because much of what you are discussing is confidential.</p>

<h2>Safeguarding 'cry for help'</h2>

<p>A couple of weeks ago I read a great column by Keziah Featherstone. Writing for Tes, she gave excellent <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/what-do-when-you-hear-out-hours-cry-help"">advice to teachers</a> who might hear a ""cry for help"" from a pupil outside of school hours.</p>

<p>However, the chances are that the first people these pupils will turn to will be friends their own age. Friends will be the ones they text in the middle of the night. Friends will be the ones who know about the cuts or the abusive relationships. Friends will notice the pro-anorexia Instagram groups that a pupil is following. Friends will pick up on the signs and symptoms of poor mental wellbeing, because more and more schools are raising awareness in PSHE lessons. And it is likely that friends, in trying to be loyal and supportive will attempt to carry this burden all on their own.</p>

<p>We need to look after the <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/pastoral-care-and-pupil-matters"">wellbeing of all pupils</a> and be aware of the strains of trying to support a friend. This is where having a team of designated safeguarding people is useful. Allocate each child with a DSP and focus on their needs. The DSP team can then have meetings to look at the bigger picture and discuss how to help everyone.</p>

<p>And for those pupils who approach you directly about a friend, here are some tips on how to respond:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Listen</li>
	<li>Don’t judge them, even when they are being very honest about how their friend is making them feel</li>
	<li>Remember, you are speaking to a young person and not an adult, so they will need support</li>
	<li>Remove any guilt that the pupil might be feeling for either ""telling on"" their friend, or anger they might be feeling for their friend’s emotional offload</li>
	<li>Remind them that their friend’s actions are not their responsibility</li>
	<li>Give them permission to offload and to encourage them to be honest with their friend about how they are feeling</li>
	<li>Explain that the school is here to support them, no matter what</li>
</ol>

374445,"Without family support, ‘attainment will not rise’","Link between adult education and school is ‘obvious’ but ignored, says college principal","<p>Closing the attainment gap will be impossible without more consideration of adult learning, according to the new principal of Newbattle Abbey College.</p>

<p>Speaking on her first day as principal, Marian Docherty, who was previously depute principal at the college for nearly nine years, says that while the government’s focus on raising attainment in schools is “right”, the policy’s full potential can never be realised without also addressing the wider lack of opportunities for families.</p>

<p>The former secondary school headteacher says: “The more you work with young people in schools, the more apparent it is that the learning opportunities for their families are critical. You are never going to raise attainment in high schools, and in school generally, unless you also tackle adult education issues. It is so obvious, but people still don’t seem to grasp that.”</p>

<p>Docherty adds: “People are focusing too much on the very genuine issue of raising attainment across Scotland within schools [so] maybe supporting families is too daunting, but it is a clear omission.”</p>

<p>Getting parents to engage can be a difficult ask, in particular families with social, emotional or educational challenges, whose children are not attaining in school, she says. “But if it is done in a very positive way, by trained staff who are used to working in the community, that transition can be very powerful,” continues Docherty.</p>

<p>“In terms of working with adults, if there are planned progression routes for adults that lead from part-time informal programmes, maybe linked to nurseries, to part-time learning and then to full-time learning, more people will progress. If you say ‘it’s a full-time programme, or it’s nothing’, the gap gets wider.”</p>

<p>Improving adult education would have a positive knock-on effect on school-aged learners within the family, she says: “The research and my experience suggest that. Not just in terms of the role-model status, but if you are exposing yourself to educational opportunities, you are more inclined to engage with your children.”</p>

<p>Any such initiative, she stresses, would need not only funding, but also staff expertise – ideally from those who have worked across more than one education sector – and planned learner pathways.</p>

<p>The idea that education staff should gain experience in more than one part of the system is important to the former English and Italian teacher, who also worked as an inspector of post-16 institutions and as national development officer for the Scottish Open Learning Consortium. “I genuinely believe it is very important for people to work across sectors,” she says. “We see far too many people who lodge in one sector, they understand that one very well, but they don’t understand the agenda in other sectors.”</p>

<p>Being a principal in an organisation she knows so well is “a nice feeling”, says Docherty. “It is a nice place to be, and a place based on sound principles that haven’t changed in the past 80 years. That makes the experience very positive. But if it wasn’t a challenge, it would be very boring.”</p>

<h2>Unique status</h2>

<p>Newbattle Abbey College is different to other FE institutions, not just because of its architecture and history. The college has about 120 full-time and between 50 and 60 part-time students. And although it has greatly expanded its provision from just one access to higher education course about 10 years ago to a range of courses now – from an HNC in social sciences, to rural skills, preparation for FE, and Gaelic and Celtic-studies courses – the breadth of offer is still more limited than elsewhere.</p>

<p>Newbattle is also Scotland’s national adult-education college. And although the increase in courses has led to a diversification of the student cohort, says Docherty, “most of our learners are still significantly older than at other colleges.”</p>

<p>The college has between 80 and 90 residential places, mostly occupied by arts and social science students. It was spared the significant structural changes experienced by much of the sector in recent years, which saw colleges merge and organised by region.</p>

<p>“We have retained our independent status as a national institution that works in partnership with other colleges but stands alone. So one can emphasise and sympathise with other colleges, but we are quite happy that the [Scottish Funding Council] has seen fit to leave us standing alone,” says Docherty.</p>

<p>The college has, however, increased its level of partnership work with other colleges, including Edinburgh College and other colleges offering Gaelic and Celtic studies.</p>

<p>Leaving Newbattle Abbey standing alone despite its size could be justified “for several reasons, first of all because of its national status”, she says. While other colleges operate in their specific area, she explains, Newbattle works across the country.</p>

<p>“In terms of the specific subjects we offer, very few colleges offer those. And this college – with its rich tradition – exemplifies the importance of adult education. I’m not saying other colleges are not interested in it, but that has not been a priority for other colleges.”</p>

<p>In its national role, the college has now run five consecutive national conferences on adult learning. It also runs the Adult Achievement Awards, which were launched in 2015 and have seen the participation of about 400 students. The scheme has completed its two-year pilot phase, and the college hopes to expand the awards to the rest of Scotland, the UK and Europe. “We are planning significant expansion,” says Docherty.</p>

<p>The awards are not the only growth area for the college – it is also exploring the development of a second HNC in heritage, tourism and events, exploiting the distinctive nature of Newbattle, and is also in the process of developing what it believes to be Scotland’s first forest leadership awards. “Newbattle will be the national accreditation centre for these awards,” Docherty says, proudly. “The demand for that is already very significant.”</p>

<p>The biggest challenge, according to the new principal, will be maintaining and developing the college’s national role and, at the same time, responding to the current regional outcome agreements and working with people locally. “Finance is obviously an issue for every college,” she adds.</p>

<p>However, Docherty believes that “without an institution that is actively promoting adult education, there would be a significant gap” – and she feels reassured that this fact is being recognised in Scotland.</p>

374610,Can headteachers in Scotland's small schools cope with more powers?,Concerns raised about impact of Scottish reforms on headteachers who spend much of their working week teaching classes ,"<p>MSPs have highlighted concerns that headteachers in <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/rural-schools-miss-out-anti-poverty-funds"">smaller and rural schools</a> may not be able to cope with the extra powers coming their way.</p>

<p>As part of <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/autonomy-sweeping-new-powers-announced-scottish-schools"">wide-ranging reforms</a>, the Scottish government wants to give teachers greater responsibility for areas such as curriculum design and the recruitment of staff.</p>

<p>However, in a letter <a href=""http://www.parliament.scot/S5_Education/Inquiries/20180208ES.OUTEdReform.pdf"">sent to education secretary John Swinney today</a>, the Scottish Parliament’s Education and Skills Committee warns that this reform will not work unless steps are taken to help schools that are less able to adapt.</p>

<p>After taking evidence on the government’s education reforms from hundreds of people, the committee advised Swinney that “the capacity of headteachers and their schools to absorb additional responsibilities will, of course, not be uniform across the country and there is a potential risk to effective implementation if the correct support is not provided”.</p>

<p>A “central question”, the committee added, was “whether the impact on different types of schools has been assessed, including smaller and larger schools, schools from different geographic areas and areas of different levels of deprivation, and of course between primary, secondary and special education schools”.</p>

<h2>The role of Scottish headteachers</h2>

<p>Headteachers and academics had told the committee that many heads in Scotland, particularly in primary schools, were teaching regularly: some are teaching heads and spend most of their time in the classroom, while others are plugging gaps caused by staff shortages.</p>

<p>The committee said it was “unclear how more responsibilities could be managed by teachers working in these circumstances”. It also questioned whether the new powers for headteachers would “unintentionally deter some teachers from seeking promotion to this level”.</p>

<p>A Scottish government spokeswoman said: “Our education reforms are focused on giving schools and headteachers more power and money to raise standards and close the attainment gap. They will deliver extra help for teachers in the classroom, more professional development and a stronger voice for parents and pupils.</p>

<p>“We also want headteachers to feel supported and empowered, which is why our recent consultation on the Education (Scotland) Bill sought views on the support they would need to be able to take forward their [Headteachers’ Charter] functions. We are currently considering the responses received.”</p>

<p>Tes Scotland reported last month that primary school leaders’ body the AHDS had <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/primary-headteachers-embrace-plans-empower-scottish-schools"">broadly welcomed the plans</a> to <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/new-charter-would-turn-heads-hr-managers"">give heads in Scotland more power</a> – although some are daunted at the prospect, with one describing it as “terrifying”. Teaching unions have warned that the proposals could see heads becoming overladen with HR and administration tasks.</p>

<p>In November, Tes reported the claims of schools minister Nick Gibb that <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/schools-freed-scourge-ofsted-teaching-style-says-nick-gibb"">greater autonomy for schools</a> had freed teachers in England from being dictated to by education inspectorate Ofsted.</p>

374634,"Robots will never replace teachers, says science centre chief","Empathy and other essential qualities in the classroom cannot be replicated by artificial intelligence, he believes","<p>Teachers’ skills will never be rendered obsolete by <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/will-you-survive-ai-revolution"">artificial intelligence</a> (AI), according to the chief executive of Scotland’s biggest science centre.</p>

<p>Stephen Breslin, of Glasgow Science Centre, believes that the ability to <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/how-my-stammer-made-me-a-better-teacher"">empathise with students</a> will always differentiate humans from machines.</p>

<p>“You could never replace that absolutely essential personal connection,” says Breslin, of a student-teacher bond which helps identify and resolve pupils’ highly individual learning problems.</p>

<p>In an interview with <em>Tes Scotland</em>, Breslin lists several qualities of a good teacher which he believes AI cannot match: “<a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/empathy-and-experience-are-enemies-extremism"">Empathy</a>, helping young people develop social skills, communication skills, helping them <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/toyoufromtes-it-possible-teach-or-even-define-creativity"">explore the creative process</a>, develop <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/collaborative-problem-solving-must-be-placed-heart-our-curriculum"">problem-solving abilities</a>, helping them to create and imagine – these are the things that you can’t automate, and they remain the unique traits of human beings.”</p>

<p>He adds: “We’ll automate specific tasks and job functions, and the nature of jobs will change. But you’re always going to need that personal connection.”</p>

<p>Breslin also believes, however, that teachers will have to change the way they teach to keep pace with a fast-changing world of work, as “the key skills our young people are going to have to have [will be] based around creativity, communication, and innovative and entrepreneurial thinking”.</p>

<p>He adds that advances in technology offer “the promise of a better, more comprehensive education, which would free the teacher up to become more of a mentor and a learning coach than the source of the knowledge”, allowing greater personalisation of learning in school.</p>

<p>Breslin is in the process of preparing <a href=""https://www.glasgowsciencecentre.org/support-us/upcoming-projects"">Idea #59</a>, a showcase exhibition on AI, big data and robotics to open late this year or early in 2019. A longer piece on his interview appears in today's issue of <em>Tes Scotland</em>.</p>

<p>In January, new education secretary Damian Hinds said that technology would <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/damian-hinds-technology-will-ease-teachers-workloads-not-steal-their"">make teachers’ jobs easier</a> but would not replace them.</p>

<p>Last year, however, Sir Anthony Seldon – vice-chancellor of the University of Buckingham and a former headteacher – argued that the inspirational teachers of the future would be <a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/machines-will-replace-teachers-within-10-years"">intelligent machines rather than humans</a>.</p>

374919,Institute for Apprenticeships to change funding system as current approach 'doesn't work well',"Stakeholders have said the process is too slow and leads to delays and frustration, while costing information is required too early ","<p>The Institute for Apprenticeships is to change its process for setting funding bands after stakeholders said the current system “doesn’t work well”.</p>

<p>A blog posted on the IfA website states: “You’ve told us that the process is too slow – leading to delays and frustration – and that we’re asking for detailed costing information too early in the process.”</p>

<p>The changes being made will mean:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Trailblazer groups will get an initial funding band allocation when their proposal is approved, which is much earlier on in the process than currently</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Funding evidence forms will only have to be provided once, and we have redesigned our forms to make them easier to use</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Funding processes will be faster as we join up with the approval of proposals, standards and assessment plans to improve customer service</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Streamlining its processes</strong></h2>

<p>In most cases, this will mean trailblazer groups will find out their initial funding band allocation when their proposal is approved – and then their final funding band recommendation at the same time as their assessment plan is approved.</p>

<p>The blog continued: “We plan to introduce these changes as soon as possible. We’ll write to all existing trailblazer groups to tell them when the changes will happen, and what it means for them. We’ll also put in place transitional arrangements for those proposals, standards and assessment plans which are already part-way through the approvals process.”</p>

<p>Last week the IfA<a href=""https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-news/institute-apprenticeships-promises-speed-standards-delivery""> set out reforms to streamline its processes </a>after being told to ""really speed up"" by skills minister Anne Milton.</p>
