# points to note:
# (a) I found it very difficult to override this for error-trapping because of the entity type gubbing
# (b) any errors (when running the group via drush) causes the import to fail... not so when running via the UI... wtf!
# (c) single file per photo field, which is because of the uri functionality -- this is a bit artificial as the true
#     extract will be via SQL so can force a single row per file etc
