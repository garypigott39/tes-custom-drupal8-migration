# News Migration Process Plugins

So, where possible we have relied on the use of existing process plugins which are then used in the migration config YML files (e.g. explode, etc).

That said, plugins have been written to make our migration life easier, and in the course of developing (improving) the migration process may have become obsolete - e.g. ChooseValue, TrimCharacters. 

Still these may prove useful in other migrations, or if nothing else were a useful training exercise.
